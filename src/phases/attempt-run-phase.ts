    /*  The way the escape chance works is by looking at the difference between your speed and the enemy field's average speed as a ratio. The higher this ratio, the higher your chance of success.
     *  However, there is a cap for the ratio of your speed vs enemy speed which beyond that point, you won't gain any advantage. It also looks at how many times you've tried to escape.
     *  Again, the more times you've tried to escape, the higher your odds of escaping. Bosses and non-bosses are calculated differently - bosses are harder to escape from vs non-bosses
     *  Finally, there's a minimum and maximum escape chance as well so that escapes aren't guaranteed, yet they are never 0 either.
     *  The percentage chance to escape from a pokemon for both bosses and non bosses is linear and based on the minimum and maximum chances, and the speed ratio cap.
     *
     *  At the time of writing, these conditions should be met:
     *   - The minimum escape chance should be 5% for bosses and non bosses
     *   - Bosses should have a maximum escape chance of 25%, whereas non-bosses should be 95%
     *   - The bonus per previous escape attempt should be 2% for bosses and 10% for non-bosses
     *   - The speed ratio cap should be 6x for bosses and 4x for non-bosses
     *   - The "default" escape chance when your speed equals the enemy speed should be 8.33% for bosses and 27.5% for non-bosses
     *
     *  From the above, we can calculate the below values
