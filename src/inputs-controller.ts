/**
 * Manages and handles all input controls for the game, including keyboard and gamepad interactions.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This class is designed to centralize input management across the game. It facilitates the setup,
 * configuration, and handling of all game inputs, making it easier to manage various input devices
 * such as keyboards and gamepads. The class provides methods for setting up input devices, handling
 * their events, and responding to changes in input state (e.g., button presses, releases).
 *
 * The `InputsController` class also includes mechanisms to handle game focus events to ensure input
 * states are correctly reset and managed when the game loses or regains focus, maintaining robust
 * and responsive control handling throughout the game's lifecycle.
 *
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * - Initializing and configuring gamepad and keyboard controls.
 * - Emitting events related to specific input actions.
 * - Responding to external changes such as gamepad connection/disconnection.
 * - Managing game state transitions in response to input events, particularly focus loss and recovery.
 *
 * Usage of this class is intended to simplify input management across various parts of the game,
 * providing a unified interface for all input-related interactions.

     * This method checks both lock variables (`buttonLock` and `buttonLock2`).

     * This action frees the button to be processed again, ensuring it can respond to new inputs.
