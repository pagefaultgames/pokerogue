 * # Balance: Moveset Generation Configuration
 *
 * This module contains configuration constants and functions that control
 * the limitations and rules around moveset generation for generated Pokémon.
 *
 *
 * ### Move Weights
 *
 * The various move weight constants in this module control how likely
 * certain categories of moves are to appear in a generated Pokémon's
 * moveset. Higher weights make a move more likely to be chosen.
 * The constants here specify the *base* weight for a move when first computed.
 * These weights are post-processed (and then scaled up such that weights have a larger impact,
 * for instance, on boss Pokémon) before being used in the actual moveset generation.
 *
 * Post Processing of weights includes, but is not limited to:
 * - Adjusting weights of status moves
 * - Adjusting weights based on the move's power relative to the highest power available
 * - Adjusting weights based on the stat the move uses to calculate damage relative to the higher stat
 *
 *
 * All weights go through additional post-processing based on
 * their expected power (accuracy * damage * expected number of hits)
 *
 * @module
