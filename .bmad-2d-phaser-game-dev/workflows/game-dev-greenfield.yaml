  workflow_end:
    action: move_to_story_development
    notes: All design artifacts complete. Begin story-driven development phase. Use Game Scrum Master to create implementation stories from design documents.
  prototype_sequence:
    - step: prototype_scope
      action: assess_prototype_complexity
      notes: First, assess if this needs full game design (use full_game_sequence) or can be a rapid prototype.
    - agent: game-designer
      creates: game-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - quick_brainstorming
        - concept_validation
      notes: "Create focused game brief for prototype. Emphasize core mechanics and immediate playability. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final game-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."
    - agent: game-designer
      creates: prototype-design.md
      uses: create-doc prototype-design OR create-game-story
      requires: game-brief.md
      notes: Create minimal design document or jump directly to implementation stories for rapid prototyping. Choose based on prototype complexity.
  prototype_workflow_end:
    action: move_to_rapid_implementation
    notes: Prototype defined. Begin immediate implementation with Game Developer. Focus on core mechanics first, then iterate based on playtesting.

  decision_guidance:
    use_full_sequence_when:
      - Building commercial or production games
      - Multiple team members involved
      - Complex gameplay systems (3+ core mechanics)
      - Long-term development timeline (2+ months)
      - Need comprehensive documentation for team coordination
      - Targeting multiple platforms
      - Educational or enterprise game projects
    use_prototype_sequence_when:
      - Game jams or time-constrained development
      - Solo developer or very small team
