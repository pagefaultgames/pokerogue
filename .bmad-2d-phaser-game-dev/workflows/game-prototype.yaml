  name: Game Prototype Development
  description: Fast-track workflow for rapid game prototyping and concept validation. Optimized for game jams, proof-of-concept development, and quick iteration on game mechanics using Phaser 3 and TypeScript.
  type: prototype
  project_types:
    - game-jam
    - proof-of-concept
    - mechanic-test
    - technical-demo
    - learning-project
    - rapid-iteration
  prototype_sequence:
    - step: concept_definition
      agent: game-designer
      duration: 15-30 minutes
      creates: concept-summary.md
      notes: Quickly define core game concept, primary mechanic, and target experience. Focus on what makes this game unique and fun.
    - step: rapid_design
      agent: game-designer
      duration: 30-60 minutes
      creates: prototype-spec.md
      requires: concept-summary.md
      optional_steps:
        - quick_brainstorming
        - reference_research
      notes: Create minimal but complete design specification. Focus on core mechanics, basic controls, and success/failure conditions.
    - step: technical_planning
      agent: game-developer
      duration: 15-30 minutes
      creates: prototype-architecture.md
      requires: prototype-spec.md
      notes: Define minimal technical implementation plan. Identify core Phaser 3 systems needed and performance constraints.
    - step: implementation_stories
      agent: game-sm
      duration: 30-45 minutes
      creates: prototype-stories/
      requires: prototype-spec.md, prototype-architecture.md
      notes: Create 3-5 focused implementation stories for core prototype features. Each story should be completable in 2-4 hours.
    - step: iterative_development
      agent: game-developer
      duration: varies
      implements: prototype-stories/
      notes: Implement stories in priority order. Test frequently and adjust design based on what feels fun. Document discoveries.
  workflow_end:
    action: prototype_evaluation
    notes: "Prototype complete. Evaluate core mechanics, gather feedback, and decide next steps: iterate, expand, or archive."
  game_jam_sequence:
    - step: jam_concept
      agent: game-designer
      duration: 10-15 minutes
      creates: jam-concept.md
      notes: Define game concept based on jam theme. One sentence core mechanic, basic controls, win condition.
    - step: jam_implementation
      agent: game-developer
      duration: varies (jam timeline)
      creates: working-prototype
      requires: jam-concept.md
      notes: Directly implement core mechanic. No formal stories - iterate rapidly on what's fun. Document major decisions.
  jam_workflow_end:
    action: jam_submission
    notes: Submit to game jam. Capture lessons learned and consider post-jam development if concept shows promise.

  decision_guidance:
    use_prototype_sequence_when:
      - Learning new game development concepts
      - Testing specific game mechanics
      - Building portfolio pieces
      - Have 1-7 days for development
      - Need structured but fast development
      - Want to validate game concepts before full development
    use_game_jam_sequence_when:
      - Participating in time-constrained game jams
      - Have 24-72 hours total development time
      - Want to experiment with wild or unusual concepts
      - Learning through rapid iteration
      - Building networking/portfolio presence
  prototype_best_practices:
    scope_management:
      - Start with absolute minimum viable gameplay
      - One core mechanic implemented well beats many mechanics poorly
      - Focus on "game feel" over features
      - Cut features ruthlessly to meet timeline
    rapid_iteration:
      - Test the game every 1-2 hours of development
      - Ask "Is this fun?" frequently during development
      - Be willing to pivot mechanics if they don't feel good
      - Document what works and what doesn't
    technical_efficiency:
      - Use simple graphics (geometric shapes, basic sprites)
      - Leverage Phaser 3's built-in systems heavily
      - Avoid complex custom systems in prototypes
      - Prioritize functional over polished
  prototype_evaluation_criteria:
    core_mechanic_validation:
      - Is the primary mechanic engaging for 30+ seconds?
      - Do players understand the mechanic without explanation?
      - Does the mechanic have depth for extended play?
      - Are there natural difficulty progression opportunities?
    technical_feasibility:
      - Does the prototype run at acceptable frame rates?
      - Are there obvious technical blockers for expansion?
      - Is the codebase clean enough for further development?
      - Are performance targets realistic for full game?
    player_experience:
      - Do testers engage with the game voluntarily?
      - What emotions does the game create in players?
      - Are players asking for "just one more try"?
      - What do players want to see added or changed?
