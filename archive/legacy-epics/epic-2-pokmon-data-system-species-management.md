# Epic 2: Pokémon Data System & Species Management

## Epic Goal
Migrate all Pokémon species data, forms, abilities, movesets, stats, nature system, and individual Pokémon instance management to AO handlers, establishing the foundational data layer for all battle and collection mechanics.

## Story 2.1: Species Database Migration
As a **game data architect**,
I want **to migrate the complete Pokémon species database to AO handlers**,
so that **all Pokémon data is accessible via AO messages and forms the foundation for battles and collection**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All Pokémon species data (800+ species) migrated to AO process storage
2. Species forms and variants properly structured and queryable
3. Base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed) accurately stored
4. Type effectiveness data accessible for battle calculations
5. Species evolution chains and conditions preserved
6. Breeding compatibility data maintained for egg mechanics
7. Species rarity and encounter data available for spawn systems
8. Query handlers enable efficient species lookup by ID, name, or type

## Story 2.2: Pokémon Ability System
As a **battle system developer**,
I want **to implement the complete ability system with all 300+ abilities**,
so that **Pokémon abilities function identically to the current game during battles**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All abilities migrated with proper effect definitions
2. Ability triggers (on switch-in, on attack, on damage, etc.) implemented
3. Hidden abilities and regular abilities properly distinguished
4. Ability inheritance rules for breeding maintained
5. Ability changing items and moves supported
6. Multi-target ability effects handled correctly
7. Ability interactions with other abilities resolved properly
8. Passive abilities separated from battle abilities for unlockable system

## Story 2.3: Nature & Individual Value System
As a **Pokémon mechanics specialist**,
I want **to implement nature effects and IV/stat calculation systems**,
so that **each Pokémon has unique stats and personality traits affecting battle performance**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All 25 natures implemented with proper stat modifications (+10%/-10%)
2. Individual Values (IVs) system maintains 0-31 range for all stats
3. Stat calculation formulas match current game exactly
4. Nature-based stat changes apply correctly in battle
5. IV inheritance rules for breeding preserved
6. Shiny determination based on IVs maintained
7. Hidden Power type calculation (if used) remains accurate
8. Stat stage modifications interact properly with base stats

## Story 2.4: Individual Pokémon Instance Management
As a **player data manager**,
I want **to create and manage individual Pokémon instances with unique properties**,
so that **each captured Pokémon maintains its identity, stats, and battle history**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Unique Pokémon ID generation for each captured/hatched Pokémon
2. Individual stat tracking (level, experience, friendship, etc.)
3. Move learning and forgetting system maintains move history
4. Pokémon nickname system preserves player customization
5. Gender determination and display handled correctly
6. Shiny status and variant tracking maintained
7. Battle participation tracking (for experience and friendship)
8. Pokémon ownership validation prevents unauthorized access
