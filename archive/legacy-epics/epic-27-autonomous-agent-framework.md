# Epic 27: Autonomous Agent Framework

## Epic Goal
Implement agent discovery protocols, battle message APIs, mixed human-agent gameplay, and spectating systems for AI participation, enabling autonomous agents as first-class players.

## Story 27.1: Agent Discovery & Registration
As a **agent infrastructure architect**,
I want **to implement agent discovery and registration systems**,
so that **autonomous agents can find and connect to game processes for participation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent discovery protocol enables agents to find available game processes automatically
2. Agent registration system validates agent credentials and capabilities before allowing access
3. Agent capability advertisement allows agents to specify their supported game modes and features
4. Agent matchmaking connects compatible agents with appropriate game sessions
5. Agent authentication validates agent identity through cryptographic verification
6. Agent reputation system tracks agent behavior and performance for trust scoring
7. Agent rate limiting prevents spam and abuse while allowing legitimate participation
8. Agent documentation provides clear specifications for agent developers

## Story 27.2: Agent Battle Message API
As a **agent API developer**,
I want **to create comprehensive message APIs for agent battle participation**,
so that **agents can participate in battles using the same mechanics as human players**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Battle action API allows agents to select moves, targets, and battle decisions
2. Game state query API provides agents with current battle information and options
3. Party management API enables agents to manage their Pok√©mon teams and items
4. Real-time battle updates notify agents of battle events and state changes
5. Turn timing API manages agent response timeouts and turn completion
6. Error handling API provides clear feedback for invalid actions or requests
7. Battle result API delivers outcome information and post-battle rewards
8. API versioning maintains compatibility while allowing system evolution

## Story 27.3: Mixed Human-Agent Gameplay
As a **mixed gameplay coordinator**,
I want **to enable seamless interaction between human players and autonomous agents**,
so that **humans and agents can play together in the same game sessions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Human-agent battle matching creates fair matchups between human and agent players
2. Agent behavior transparency shows human players when they're facing agents
3. Mixed team gameplay allows humans and agents to cooperate in team-based modes
4. Agent difficulty scaling ensures challenging but fair competition for human players
5. Agent learning prevention stops agents from gaining unfair advantages through data mining
6. Fair play enforcement ensures agents follow the same rules as human players
7. Agent identification allows humans to know when interacting with agents
8. Mixed leaderboards track performance across both human and agent participants

## Story 27.4: Agent Spectating & Analysis Systems
As a **agent observation specialist**,
I want **to implement spectating systems that allow observation of agent gameplay**,
so that **humans can watch agent strategies and agents can learn from observation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Agent spectating interface allows humans to watch agent battles in real-time
2. Agent strategy analysis displays decision-making patterns and tactical approaches
3. Agent performance metrics show statistical analysis of agent effectiveness
4. Agent replay system enables reviewing agent games for analysis and learning
5. Agent comparison tools allow evaluating different agents' strategies and performance
6. Educational features help humans understand and learn from agent strategies
7. Research data collection gathers information about agent behavior for analysis
8. Privacy controls ensure appropriate access to agent spectating and data
