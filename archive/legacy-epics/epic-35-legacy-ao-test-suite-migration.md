# Epic 35: Legacy AO Test Suite Migration

## Epic Goal
Migrate existing comprehensive AO process test suite (350+ test files) to integrate with the new aolite-based testing framework while preserving test coverage, organizational structure, and maintaining zero regression in test functionality.

## Story 35.1: Test Suite Inventory and Migration Planning
As a **test migration engineer**,
I want **to conduct comprehensive audit of existing test suite and develop detailed migration strategy**,
so that **I can execute a risk-assessed phased migration with rollback capabilities**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete inventory of 350+ test files with categorization and complexity assessment
2. Documentation of existing custom test framework components and dependencies
3. Migration complexity matrix identifying low/medium/high risk tests
4. Phased migration plan with timeline and resource requirements
5. Risk assessment with mitigation strategies for complex test cases
6. Rollback plan for reverting to legacy system if needed
7. Success criteria and validation approach for each migration phase

## Story 35.2: aolite Migration Tooling and Framework Adapters
As a **test automation engineer**,
I want **to develop migration tooling and framework adapters to automate test conversion**,
so that **I can standardize and accelerate the migration of existing tests to aolite patterns**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated migration tool for converting basic test cases to aolite patterns
2. aolite adapter layer preserving existing assertion library interfaces
3. Migration templates for each test category (unit, integration, performance, etc.)
4. Test validation framework to compare old vs new test behavior
5. Parallel test execution capability for migration validation
6. Migration progress tracking and reporting tools
7. Documentation for migration tool usage and troubleshooting

## Story 35.3: Unit Test Migration to aolite Framework
As a **QA engineer**,
I want **to migrate existing unit tests to use aolite.spawnProcess() and aolite.send() patterns**,
so that **I can preserve test logic and coverage while gaining aolite's enhanced capabilities**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All unit test files converted to aolite-based execution patterns
2. Test coverage maintained at 100% of original coverage levels
3. Migrated tests demonstrate identical pass/fail behavior to originals
4. Enhanced state inspection capabilities integrated where beneficial
5. Unit test execution performance meets or exceeds original performance
6. Updated test documentation reflecting aolite integration patterns
7. Validation report confirming zero regression in test functionality

## Story 35.4: Integration Test Migration and Multi-Process Enhancement
As a **integration test specialist**,
I want **to migrate integration tests to leverage aolite's concurrent process capabilities**,
so that **I can improve multi-process workflow validation and state consistency checking**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All integration tests converted to aolite multi-process execution model
2. Enhanced concurrent process testing capabilities demonstrated
3. State consistency validation improved across multiple processes
4. Integration test scenarios maintain complete coverage of existing workflows
5. Process coordination and synchronization enhanced through aolite.runScheduler()
6. Integration test performance improved through concurrent execution
7. Multi-process error handling and recovery testing enhanced

## Story 35.5: Performance, Security, and Specialized Test Migration
As a **specialized test engineer**,
I want **to migrate remaining test categories with category-specific aolite enhancements**,
so that **I can complete migration while improving specialized testing capabilities**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Performance tests migrated with enhanced metrics collection via aolite logging
2. Security tests converted with improved process isolation capabilities
3. Fault-tolerance tests enhanced with aolite process lifecycle management
4. Parity tests updated with concurrent process comparison capabilities
5. All specialized test categories maintain 100% of original coverage
6. Enhanced testing capabilities demonstrated in each specialized category
7. Specialized test execution integrated with overall aolite test suite

## Story 35.6: Legacy System Decommissioning and Final Validation
As a **test infrastructure manager**,
I want **to decommission legacy test infrastructure after validating complete migration success**,
so that **I can establish unified aolite-based testing with no dual maintenance burden**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive validation confirming 100% test functionality migration
2. Side-by-side test result comparison showing identical behavior
3. Legacy test framework components safely removed from codebase
4. All documentation updated to reflect aolite-based testing procedures
5. Development team training completed on new testing workflows
6. Migration success metrics validated and documented
7. Post-migration monitoring plan established for ongoing validation
