# Epic 26: AOConnect UI Bridge Integration

## Epic Goal
Integrate existing Phaser interface with AO backend through AOConnect, enabling current players to access AO benefits through familiar UI while maintaining identical gameplay experience.

## Story 26.1: AOConnect Integration Layer
As a **UI integration architect**,
I want **to implement the AOConnect bridge that connects Phaser UI to AO handlers**,
so that **existing players can use familiar interface while gaining AO benefits**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AOConnect library integration establishes reliable connection between browser and AO process
2. Message translation layer converts UI actions to appropriate AO handler messages
3. Response handling translates AO handler responses back to UI-compatible formats
4. Connection state management handles network interruptions and reconnection gracefully
5. Authentication flow integrates wallet connection with game session establishment
6. Error handling provides meaningful feedback for connection and message failures
7. Performance optimization ensures minimal latency between UI actions and AO responses
8. Backward compatibility maintains support for existing save data during transition

## Story 26.2: Real-time UI Synchronization
As a **UI synchronization specialist**,
I want **to maintain real-time synchronization between UI state and AO process state**,
so that **players see immediate updates without UI lag or inconsistencies**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. State synchronization keeps UI display current with AO process data changes
2. Battle state updates reflect move results, damage, and status changes immediately
3. Inventory synchronization shows item usage and acquisition in real-time
4. Party management updates display Pokémon changes and modifications instantly
5. Progress tracking synchronization maintains current advancement status
6. Collection updates show new captures and discoveries without delay
7. Conflict resolution handles simultaneous updates from multiple sources
8. Offline handling gracefully manages disconnection and reconnection scenarios

## Story 26.3: Cross-Device Experience Continuity
As a **cross-platform experience designer**,
I want **to enable seamless gameplay continuation across different devices**,
so that **players can switch devices without losing progress or experiencing friction**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Device handoff allows switching between desktop and mobile seamlessly
2. Session persistence maintains game state when switching access methods
3. UI adaptation adjusts interface appropriately for different screen sizes and input methods
4. Save state synchronization ensures consistent game state across all devices
5. Settings synchronization maintains player preferences across different platforms
6. Performance adaptation optimizes experience for different device capabilities
7. Input method flexibility supports keyboard, mouse, and touch interactions appropriately
8. Accessibility consistency maintains same accessibility features across all platforms

## Story 26.4: Legacy Player Migration
As a **player migration coordinator**,
I want **to facilitate smooth transition for existing players to AO-based system**,
so that **current players retain their progress while gaining AO advantages**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Save data migration transfers existing progress to AO process storage
2. Collection preservation maintains all captured Pokémon and completion status
3. Achievement migration preserves earned accomplishments and progression
4. Settings migration maintains player preferences and customizations
5. Migration validation ensures no data loss during transition process
6. Rollback capability provides safety net in case migration issues occur
7. Migration progress tracking shows status and completion of transfer process
8. Post-migration verification confirms successful data transfer and system functionality
