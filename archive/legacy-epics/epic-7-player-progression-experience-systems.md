# Epic 7: Player Progression & Experience Systems

## Epic Goal
Port player character data, Pokémon leveling, evolution mechanics, experience gain, friendship systems, and level cap functionality to AO processes, enabling character and Pokémon growth.

## Story 7.1: Experience & Leveling System
As a **progression mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement experience point calculation and Pokémon leveling with proper curve handling**,
so that **Pokémon gain experience and level up identically to current game with correct stat growth**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Experience point calculation based on defeated Pokémon's level and base experience
2. Experience sharing among party members follows current distribution rules
3. Level progression follows species-specific growth curves (Fast, Medium Fast, etc.)
4. Stat calculation upon level up uses proper base stats + IV + EV formulas
5. Experience gain modifiers (Lucky Egg, traded Pokémon bonus) apply correctly
6. Level cap enforcement prevents over-leveling based on game progression
7. Experience notification and level-up messages display appropriately
8. Evolution level requirements check correctly during level progression

## Story 7.2: Pokémon Evolution System
As a **evolution specialist**,
I want **to implement all evolution methods and conditions with proper triggering**,
so that **Pokémon evolve using identical conditions and timing to current game**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Level-based evolution triggers at correct levels during level-up process
2. Stone-based evolution validates item usage and species compatibility
3. Trade-based evolution handles evolution conditions properly
4. Friendship-based evolution checks friendship thresholds and timing conditions
5. Time-based evolution considers day/night cycles and time restrictions
6. Location-based evolution validates current biome/area requirements
7. Move-based evolution checks known moves during evolution trigger
8. Evolution cancellation (pressing B) prevents unwanted evolution properly

## Story 7.3: Friendship & Affection System
As a **relationship mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement the friendship system affecting evolution and battle bonuses**,
so that **Pokémon-trainer bonds develop through interaction and affect gameplay**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Friendship increases through battle participation, leveling, and item usage
2. Friendship decreases through fainting and certain items (revival herbs)
3. Friendship levels affect evolution for friendship-dependent Pokémon
4. High friendship provides battle bonuses (critical hits, status cure, etc.)
5. Friendship checking moves and NPCs display correct friendship ranges
6. Friendship gain/loss rates match current game calculations
7. Maximum friendship caps at 255 with proper overflow handling
8. Friendship persistence maintains values across battles and sessions

## Story 7.4: Player Character Progression
As a **player progression specialist**,
I want **to track player statistics, achievements, and game completion status**,
so that **player progress through the game is recorded and persistent**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Player character data tracks name, gender, and appearance settings
2. Game progression tracking records gym badges, Elite Four, and Champion status
3. Pokédex completion tracking maintains seen/caught status for all species
4. Battle statistics record wins, losses, and battle participation
5. Money tracking maintains current balance with proper transaction logging
6. Play time tracking accumulates session time accurately
7. Player inventory management maintains items, TMs, and key items
8. Save data validation ensures player progress integrity and prevents corruption
