# Epic 36: AO Shared Runtime Architecture

## Epic Goal
Transform PokéRogue's AO process architecture from monolithic "Everything Bundling" to an efficient Shared Runtime model with module federation patterns, achieving 85-86% bundle size reduction while maintaining 100% functional parity and enhancing system maintainability.

## Context and Scope
**Enhancement Type:** Major Architectural Transformation  
**Integration Impact:** High - requires shared runtime extraction, process specialization, and module federation implementation  
**Bundle Size Impact:** Battle Process: 1.0MB → ~150KB, Pokemon Process: 718KB → ~150KB, with 500KB shared runtime

## Existing System Context

**Current Bundle Analysis (Winston's Findings):**
- Battle Process: 1.0MB (28,423 lines, 125 modules, 751 functions)
- Pokemon Process: 718KB with similar module density
- Current splitting ineffective: 1.0MB → 1.0MB core + 94B data
- Root cause: "Everything Bundling" with complete game frameworks per process

**Architectural Problems Identified:**
- Shared utilities duplicated across all processes
- Data constants replicated in every bundle
- Cross-cutting concerns embedded everywhere
- Complete game logic frameworks per process

## Enhancement Details

**Target Architecture - Shared Runtime Model:**
- Shared Runtime Core: ~500KB (common utilities, frameworks, constants)
- Specialized Process Shells: ~150KB each (process-specific logic only)
- Module Federation Pattern: Dynamic loading with shared dependencies
- Expected Results: 85-86% size reduction for specialized processes

**Integration Approach:**
- Phase 1: Extract shared runtime foundation
- Phase 2: Implement process specialization with federation
- Phase 3: Optimize and validate transformation
- Maintains AO protocol compatibility throughout

## Story 36.1: Shared Runtime Foundation Extraction

7. Integration with Pokemon and battle systems works seamlessly through shared runtime
8. Transaction processing demonstrates equivalent or improved performance characteristics

## Story 36.6: System-Wide Validation and Performance Optimization
As a **system performance validation engineer**,
I want **to validate and optimize the complete shared runtime architecture transformation**,
so that **all processes demonstrate target bundle sizes with zero functionality regression**.

### Acceptance Criteria
