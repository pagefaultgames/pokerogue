# Epic 15: World Progression & Biome System

## Epic Goal
Implement biome progression, wave mechanics, trainer encounters, gym leaders, Elite Four, Champion battles, victory conditions, and time-of-day cycles affecting spawns and events.

## Story 15.1: Biome Progression & Wave System
As a **world progression developer**,
I want **to implement biome advancement and wave-based progression mechanics**,
so that **players advance through different areas with escalating difficulty and appropriate pacing**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Wave progression advances players through biome sequences with proper difficulty scaling
2. Biome unlock conditions validate completion requirements for accessing new areas
3. Wave difficulty scaling increases Pokémon levels and trainer strength appropriately
4. Biome-specific encounter tables provide unique Pokémon spawns for each area
5. Wave completion rewards provide appropriate experience, money, and item gains
6. Biome transition mechanics handle movement between areas with proper validation
7. Wave reset mechanics allow restarting from appropriate checkpoints
8. Progress tracking maintains current wave and biome status across sessions

## Story 15.2: Trainer Encounter System
As a **trainer battle specialist**,
I want **to implement trainer encounters with proper AI and party composition**,
so that **trainer battles provide strategic challenges with varied team compositions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Trainer encounter triggering validates player progression and area requirements
2. Trainer party composition follows biome-appropriate species and level distributions
3. Trainer AI behavior provides challenging but fair battle decision-making
4. Trainer types (Youngster, Ace Trainer, etc.) have distinct party themes and strategies
5. Trainer reward calculations provide appropriate money and experience based on difficulty
6. Trainer dialogue and personality traits create engaging encounter variety
7. Trainer rematch mechanics enable repeated battles with scaled difficulty
8. Special trainer encounters (rivals, bosses) provide unique challenges and rewards

## Story 15.3: Gym Leader & Elite Four System
As a **boss battle architect**,
I want **to implement gym leaders, Elite Four, and Champion battles with unique mechanics**,
so that **major battles provide memorable challenges with type specializations and strategies**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Gym Leader battles feature type-specialized teams with appropriate movesets and strategies
2. Elite Four battles provide high-level challenges with diverse team compositions
3. Champion battle represents ultimate challenge with perfectly optimized team
4. Boss battle mechanics include unique abilities, held items, and battle strategies
5. Gym badge rewards unlock new areas, abilities, or game features appropriately
6. Elite Four progression requires defeating all members before Champion access
7. Victory conditions validate proper completion of battle objectives
8. Boss battle scaling adjusts difficulty based on player progression and party strength

## Story 15.4: Time-of-Day & Environmental Cycles
As a **environmental systems developer**,
I want **to implement day/night cycles and environmental changes affecting gameplay**,
so that **time-based mechanics create dynamic encounters and strategic timing considerations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Day/night cycle progression follows realistic time progression or accelerated game time
2. Time-based encounter modifications affect spawn rates and species availability
3. Time-dependent evolution requirements validate correct time periods for triggers
4. Environmental cycle effects influence weather patterns and terrain conditions
5. Time-sensitive events and encounters provide limited-time opportunities
6. Circadian rhythm mechanics affect Pokémon behavior and battle performance
7. Time display and tracking inform players of current time and upcoming changes
8. Time-based save validation prevents exploitation of time-dependent mechanics
