# Epic 25: Run Tracking & Session Management

## Epic Goal
Implement run completion tracking, run naming/metadata, historical run records, and player session identification leveraging AO's automatic state persistence.

## Story 25.1: Run Lifecycle Management
As a **run tracking coordinator**,
I want **to manage complete run lifecycles from start to completion**,
so that **each gameplay session is properly tracked with meaningful metadata**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Run initialization creates new run records with timestamp and configuration data
2. Run progress tracking maintains current status, milestones, and advancement
3. Run completion detection identifies successful victory or failure conditions
4. Run metadata capture records difficulty settings, challenge modes, and special conditions
5. Run duration tracking measures total play time and session length
6. Run interruption handling manages paused, resumed, and abandoned runs appropriately
7. Run validation ensures data integrity and prevents manipulation or corruption
8. Run archival system preserves completed run data for historical analysis

## Story 25.2: Run Naming & Customization
As a **run personalization specialist**,
I want **to enable player customization and naming of runs for organization**,
so that **players can organize and identify their gameplay sessions meaningfully**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Run naming system allows custom titles for easy identification and organization
2. Run description fields enable detailed notes about strategy, goals, or memorable events
3. Run tagging system supports custom labels for categorization and filtering
4. Run favorite marking highlights especially memorable or successful runs
5. Run sharing options allow displaying notable runs to community or friends
6. Run template creation saves configurations for repeated challenge attempts
7. Run comparison features enable side-by-side analysis of similar attempts
8. Run organization tools provide sorting, filtering, and search capabilities

## Story 25.3: Historical Run Records
As a **historical data curator**,
I want **to maintain comprehensive historical records of all completed runs**,
so that **players can analyze their progression and revisit past achievements**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete run history maintains records of all attempted and completed runs
2. Run outcome tracking records victory conditions, final scores, and completion status
3. Run performance metrics capture key statistics and achievement data
4. Run timeline visualization shows progression patterns over time
5. Run comparison analytics identify improvement trends and performance changes
6. Run milestone tracking celebrates significant achievements and records
7. Run data export enables sharing detailed run information with external tools
8. Run legacy preservation maintains historical data indefinitely for analysis

## Story 25.4: Session Identity & Continuity
As a **session management architect**,
I want **to manage player session identity and ensure continuity across devices**,
so that **run tracking remains consistent regardless of access method or location**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Player session identification links runs to specific players through AO cryptographic identity
2. Cross-device continuity maintains run data consistency across different access points
3. Session handoff enables seamless transition between devices during active runs
4. Concurrent session prevention avoids conflicts when same player accesses from multiple locations
5. Session recovery restores interrupted runs with minimal data loss
6. Session analytics track usage patterns and device preferences for optimization
7. Session security prevents unauthorized access to personal run data
8. Session synchronization ensures real-time updates across all active connections
