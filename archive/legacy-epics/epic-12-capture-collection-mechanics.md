# Epic 12: Capture & Collection Mechanics

## Epic Goal
Implement wild Pokémon encounters, capture mechanics, Pokéball systems, PC storage, party management, and Pokémon collection tracking, enabling the core collection gameplay loop.

## Story 12.1: Wild Pokémon Encounter System
As a **encounter system developer**,
I want **to implement wild Pokémon spawning and encounter mechanics**,
so that **players encounter wild Pokémon with proper rarity, level, and species distribution**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Wild encounter rates follow biome-specific spawn tables and probabilities
2. Wild Pokémon level ranges match current game distribution for each area
3. Shiny Pokémon encounters use proper base shiny rates with modifiers
4. Wild Pokémon stat generation creates proper IV ranges and nature distribution
5. Encounter triggering validates player location and movement requirements
6. Special encounter conditions (time of day, weather) affect spawn tables properly
7. Rare encounter mechanics handle legendary and special Pokémon spawns
8. Encounter prevention items and abilities function correctly when active

## Story 12.2: Pokéball & Capture Mechanics
As a **capture system specialist**,
I want **to implement Pokéball throwing and capture rate calculations**,
so that **Pokémon capture success rates match current game formulas exactly**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Capture rate calculations account for Pokémon HP, status effects, and ball type
2. Different Pokéball types provide appropriate capture rate modifiers
3. Status effect bonuses (sleep = 2x, paralysis/etc = 1.5x) apply correctly
4. Critical captures occur at proper rates with appropriate visual indication
5. Capture shake mechanics simulate proper number of shakes before success/failure
6. Master Ball guarantees capture of any wild Pokémon (except special cases)
7. Capture failure handles Pokémon breaking free with appropriate messaging
8. Ball consumption removes used Pokéballs from inventory after throw

## Story 12.3: PC Storage & Party Management
As a **storage system architect**,
I want **to implement PC storage and party management with proper organization**,
so that **players can store and organize their Pokémon collection efficiently**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. PC storage provides unlimited Pokémon storage with proper organization
2. Party management maintains 6-Pokémon active party with switching mechanics
3. Pokémon deposit/withdrawal validates party requirements and storage limits
4. PC box organization allows naming, sorting, and categorizing Pokémon
5. Storage search and filtering enables finding specific Pokémon quickly
6. Pokémon release mechanics confirm deletion and prevent accidental loss
7. Storage backup and recovery prevents data loss during transfers
8. Cross-device storage access maintains consistent collection state

## Story 12.4: Collection Tracking & Progress
As a **collection progress specialist**,
I want **to track capture progress and collection milestones**,
so that **players can monitor their completion status and achievements**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Species capture tracking records first-time captures and total caught
2. Form variant tracking maintains records of different forms and variants
3. Shiny collection tracking records shiny encounters and captures
4. Collection statistics calculate completion percentages and milestones
5. Capture location and date logging provides detailed collection history
6. Collection achievements trigger when reaching specific milestones
7. Collection sharing enables displaying achievements to other players
8. Collection progress synchronization maintains accurate cross-session data
