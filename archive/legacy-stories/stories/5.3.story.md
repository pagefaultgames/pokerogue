# Story 5.3: Terrain Effects System

**Epic:** 5 - Status Effects & Environmental Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **battlefield mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement terrain effects that modify the battlefield environment**,
so that **terrain-setting moves create persistent field effects that influence battle outcomes**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Electric Terrain boosts Electric-type move power by 30% for grounded Pokémon
2. Grassy Terrain boosts Grass-type moves and provides 1/16 HP healing per turn
3. Misty Terrain reduces Dragon-type move damage and prevents status conditions
4. Psychic Terrain boosts Psychic moves and prevents priority move usage
5. Terrain duration tracking with 5-turn default duration
6. Terrain interactions with abilities (Surge Surfer, etc.) function correctly
7. Terrain effects only apply to grounded Pokémon (not Flying types or Levitate)
8. Multiple terrain effects conflict resolution (newest terrain replaces previous)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic 5 completion (Stories 5.1-5.2):
- **Complete Status Effects System** with all 5 major status conditions (sleep, poison, paralysis, burn, freeze), proper damage calculations (poison: 1/8 HP, burn: 1/16 HP), status interactions and mutual exclusivity rules, comprehensive healing system through moves/items/abilities, type and ability-based immunity validation, full integration with battle handler message processing, and deterministic RNG using AO crypto module [Source: docs/stories/5.1.story.md]
- **Complete Weather System** with all weather conditions (sun, rain, sandstorm, hail) including move power modifications (±50% for fire/water in weather), weather damage (1/16 HP for sandstorm/hail), weather-ability interactions (Solar Power, Rain Dish, etc.), weather-dependent moves (Thunder, Solar Beam), weather duration tracking with 5-turn default, and complex weather-field effect interactions [Source: docs/stories/5.2.story.md]

This provides the complete foundation for implementing terrain effects with full integration into existing environmental effects system, battle turn processing, damage calculations, battle state management, and field condition interaction systems established in Epic 4 and Stories 5.1-5.2.

### Data Models

- Heavy integration testing for terrain effects within complete battle workflows including damage calculations and ability interactions

### Technical Constraints
**Deterministic Terrain Effects:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- All terrain-related random calculations must be deterministic and reproducible using battle seeds
- Never use Lua's math.random() - ALWAYS use AO crypto module for terrain-related chance calculations
- Battle RNG counter must increment for every random call including all terrain effect calculations
- All AO message responses must include success boolean for terrain effect command error handling

**Terrain Effect Persistence:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Terrain effects must be serializable for session persistence and battle replay capability
- Terrain conditions must persist correctly across turns and battle conclusions
- Terrain effect durations must maintain consistency during battle state transitions
- Terrain-weather-status interaction state must persist correctly

**Data Integrity:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- Never hardcode Pokemon/Move/Ability data - always reference database tables for terrain immunities and interactions
- Terrain healing calculations must reference actual Pokemon HP and maxHP values for accurate percentage healing
- Maintain single source of truth for terrain effect definitions and interaction rules
