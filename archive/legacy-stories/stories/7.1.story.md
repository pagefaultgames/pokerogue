# Story 7.1: Experience & Leveling System

**Epic:** 7 - Player Progression & Experience Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-02  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **progression mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement experience point calculation and Pokémon leveling with proper curve handling**,
so that **Pokémon gain experience and level up identically to current game with correct stat growth**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Experience point calculation based on defeated Pokémon's level and base experience
2. Experience sharing among party members follows current distribution rules
3. Level progression follows species-specific growth curves (Fast, Medium Fast, etc.)
4. Stat calculation upon level up uses proper base stats + IV + EV formulas
5. Experience gain modifiers (Lucky Egg, traded Pokémon bonus) apply correctly
6. Level cap enforcement prevents over-leveling based on game progression
7. Experience notification and level-up messages display appropriately
8. Evolution level requirements check correctly during level progression

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (6.4 - Positional Battle Mechanics):
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites are mandatory - create unit tests, integration tests, and extend existing tests
- **AO Integration**: Conditional loading for JSON modules and AO-specific handler registration is required for testing environments
- **Type Effectiveness**: Ensure precise calculations match TypeScript reference (previous story had Ground vs Grass miscalculation)
- **QA Process**: Implementation must pass all quality gates before completion - expect multiple review cycles
- **Behavioral Parity**: All calculations must match TypeScript implementation exactly using deterministic processing

### Data Models
**Pokemon Model Experience Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pokemon-model]:
- `exp`: number - Total experience points  
- `level`: number - Current Pokemon level (1-100)
- `stats`: table - Current battle stats recalculated on level up
- `ivs`: table - Individual values for stat calculation
- `nature`: string - Nature affecting stat growth

**Battle Model Experience Context** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#battle-model]:
- `battleSeed`: string - Deterministic RNG seed for experience calculations
- `playerParty`: table - Player's active Pokemon receiving experience
- `enemyParty`: table - Enemy Pokemon data for experience calculation base

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints found in architecture docs for experience system - system will integrate with existing battle resolution handler.

### Component Specifications
**Pokemon State Manager Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#pokemon-state-manager]:
- `recalculateStats(pokemonId)` - Stat recalculation with modifier application after level up
- `createPokemon(speciesId, level, ivs, nature)` - Pokemon instantiation with stat calculation
- `applyStatModifiers(pokemon, modifiers)` - Precise modifier application in correct order

**Battle Resolution Handler Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#battle-resolution-handler]:
- `processBattleTurn(battleCommand)` - Main battle logic entry point where experience is awarded
- Experience calculation must use AO crypto module for deterministic randomness

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `ao-processes/game-logic/progression/experience-system.lua` - Main experience calculation system
- `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/stat-calculator.lua` - Existing stat calculator for level up processing
- `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/evolution-system.lua` - Evolution integration for level-based evolution triggers

**Data Dependencies** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:

## Project Structure Notes
File locations align perfectly with existing project structure from `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. The experience system will be implemented in the designated `ao-processes/game-logic/progression/` directory, building on existing stat calculator (`ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/stat-calculator.lua`) and integrating with the battle handler (`ao-processes/handlers/battle-handler.lua`) established in Story 4.1. The implementation extends the Pokemon State Manager component patterns while integrating seamlessly with species database for growth curves and base experience values. The system leverages the deterministic RNG established in previous stories and maintains behavioral parity with TypeScript reference implementation.
