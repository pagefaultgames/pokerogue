## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**From Story 32.7 Completion Notes:** The admin process provides comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and administrative capabilities with established components (HealthMonitor, AdminCommandProcessor, MaintenanceCoordinator, AlertManager, PerformanceAggregator) that can be leveraged for deployment coordination. The process uses ADMIN level authentication and comprehensive audit logging which should be integrated into deployment operations. [Source: docs/stories/32.7.story.md Dev Agent Record]

**Key Technical Patterns from 32.7:**
- Multi-tier authentication system (BASIC/ELEVATED/ADMIN) for secure operations
- MessageCorrelator integration for distributed operation tracking
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation throughout all components
- Real-time monitoring capabilities with configurable thresholds
- Maintenance mode coordination for zero-downtime operations

### Data Models
**Deployment State Model:** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md patterns]
- Deployment tracking with correlation IDs, process dependencies, and status progression
- Process registration data including health status, version info, and capability metadata
- Configuration distribution tracking with version control and validation status
- Rollback state preservation including checkpoint data and restoration points

**Process Discovery Model:** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md patterns]  
- Process registry with capabilities, endpoints, and dependency information
- Service discovery data including process locations, health status, and load metrics
- Version management for process compatibility and migration coordination

### API Specifications

    },
    deployRequest = {
        processId = "process-to-deploy",
        version = "1.2.3",
        deploymentStrategy = "BLUE_GREEN|ROLLING|IMMEDIATE",

        sourceProcessId = "admin-process-id", 
        authToken = "admin-auth-token",
        timestamp = 1234567890
    }
}
```

**Health Validation Request:** [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md patterns]

        id = "deployment-health-correlation-id",
        requestType = "DEPLOYMENT_HEALTH_CHECK"
    },
    healthCheck = {
        deploymentId = "deployment-correlation-id",

- Cross-process dependency validation and startup sequencing tests
- Failure scenario testing including rollback procedures and error recovery
- Performance testing for deployment coordination overhead and scaling behavior

- Integration tests: `ao-processes/tests/integration/coordinator-deployment.test.lua`
- Performance tests: `ao-processes/tests/performance/deployment-coordination.test.lua`

### Technical Constraints  
**AO Protocol Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All deployment coordination must use native AO message passing with JSON protocol
- Process spawning and management must utilize AO process lifecycle management
- Authentication must integrate with existing ProcessAuthenticator ADMIN level system
- Message correlation must use established MessageCorrelator for deployment tracking

**Deployment Infrastructure:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Lua 5.3 compatibility for all deployment coordination logic
- Integration with existing deployment scripts in bash/shell for AO network interaction
- Use of AO crypto module for any deployment-related random generation or security tokens
- Compliance with AO Info handler protocol for process discovery and documentation

### Security Requirements
**Deployment Authentication:** [Source: docs/architecture/security.md patterns]
- All deployment operations require ADMIN level authentication using ProcessAuthenticator system
- Deployment requests must include proper authorization tokens and audit logging  
- Configuration distribution requires secure token validation and encrypted transmission
- Process registration and discovery must validate authenticatedinteraction

**Input Validation:** [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
- Comprehensive validation of all deployment requests and configuration data
- Process ID validation to prevent unauthorized process manipulation
- Version validation and compatibility checking for safe deployment progression
- Configuration schema validation to prevent malformed configuration distribution

### Project Structure Notes
**Structure Alignment:** The story aligns well with the existing project structure. The `ao-processes/coordinator/` directory should be created to house the deployment coordination process, following the established pattern from `ao-processes/admin/` for administrative processes. The existing `scripts/` directory contains deployment foundations (deploy-ao-process.sh, test-deployment.sh) that can be extended for multi-process coordination. No structural conflicts identified - the deployment system integrates naturally with the established multi-process architecture pattern.
