# Story 7.3: Friendship & Affection System

**Epic:** 7 - Player Progression & Experience Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-03  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **relationship mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement the friendship system affecting evolution and battle bonuses**,
so that **Pokémon-trainer bonds develop through interaction and affect gameplay**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Friendship increases through battle participation, leveling, and item usage
2. Friendship decreases through fainting and certain items (revival herbs)
3. Friendship levels affect evolution for friendship-dependent Pokémon
4. High friendship provides battle bonuses (critical hits, status cure, etc.)
5. Friendship checking moves and NPCs display correct friendship ranges
6. Friendship gain/loss rates match current game calculations
7. Maximum friendship caps at 255 with proper overflow handling
8. Friendship persistence maintains values across battles and sessions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (7.2 - Pokémon Evolution System):
- **Friendship Evolution Integration**: Evolution system already includes friendship-based evolution checking with friendship threshold validation (220+ standard)
- **Evolution System Foundation**: Complete evolution system exists in `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/evolution-system.lua` with friendship evolution support - friendship system must integrate properly
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test framework established with unit tests and integration tests - must extend existing test suites for friendship mechanics
- **Behavioral Parity**: All friendship calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly using deterministic processing
- **Data Dependencies**: Friendship tracking integration required with existing Pokemon state management and battle systems established in previous stories
- **Battle Integration**: Evolution system integrates with battle handler - friendship system must also integrate with battle resolution for friendship gain/loss during battles

### Data Models
**Pokemon Model Friendship Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pokemon-model]:
- `id`: number - Unique Pokemon instance identifier for friendship tracking
- `speciesId`: string - Species identifier from SpeciesId enum for species-specific friendship mechanics
- `level`: number - Current Pokemon level for friendship-based evolution integration
- `friendship`: number - Friendship level (0-255) for evolution conditions and battle bonuses
- `battleData`: table - Temporary battle-specific data for friendship gain/loss tracking during battles
- `statusEffect`: string|nil - Current status condition affecting friendship gain/loss rates
- `heldItem`: string|nil - Currently held item identifier for friendship-affecting items

**Battle Model Friendship Context** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#battle-model]:
- `battleId`: string - Unique battle session identifier for friendship tracking during battles
- `battleSeed`: string - Deterministic RNG seed for friendship-based battle bonus randomness
- `battleType`: string - Battle context affecting friendship gain rates (wild vs trainer battles)
- `turn`: number - Battle timing for friendship-based battle bonuses and status cures
- `playerParty`: table - Player's active Pokemon for friendship-based battle bonus effects

**Player Model Friendship Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]:
- `party`: table - Current Pokemon party (up to 6) with friendship values persistence
- `pcStorage`: table - PC Pokemon storage system maintaining friendship values across storage
- `inventory`: table - Items affecting friendship (berries, revival herbs) for friendship mechanics

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints found in architecture docs for friendship system - system will integrate with existing Pokemon State Manager and battle resolution handler for friendship tracking and bonus effects.

### Component Specifications
**Pokemon State Manager Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#pokemon-state-manager]:
- `createPokemon(speciesId, level, ivs, nature)` - Pokemon instantiation with initial friendship values (70 for caught, 120 for traded)
- `recalculateStats(pokemonId)` - Stat recalculation may need friendship bonus integration for return power calculation
- `evolvePokemon(pokemonId, evolutionId)` - Evolution processing must validate friendship thresholds for friendship-based evolution

**Battle Resolution Handler Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#battle-resolution-handler]:
- `processBattleTurn(battleCommand)` - Battle context for friendship gain from battle participation and friendship bonuses
- `calculateDamage(attacker, defender, move)` - Damage calculation may need friendship-based critical hit bonus integration
- `applyStatusEffects(pokemon, effects)` - Status condition application with potential friendship-based status cure mechanics

**Game State Coordinator Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#game-state-coordinator]:
- `saveGameState(playerId, gameData)` - Complete game state serialization including friendship values persistence
- `loadGameState(playerId)` - Game state restoration with friendship values validation

### File Locations
