**Specific Test Categories** [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]:
- **Unit Tests**: API gateway translation, session management, load balancing algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end coordinator workflows with multiple processes
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and throughput benchmarking for coordinated operations
- **Compatibility Tests**: Client API compatibility validation with existing applications

### Technical Constraints
**AO Protocol Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Lua 5.3 runtime compatibility for all coordinator components
- AO crypto module usage for correlation IDs and security operations
- JSON message format for client and inter-process communication
- Native AO handlers for message processing and routing

**Performance Requirements** [Source: Epic 32 definition]:
- Improved response times for coordinated operations compared to monolithic
- Support for concurrent request handling without performance degradation
- Efficient session management with minimal state synchronization overhead
- Load balancing overhead must be minimal (<5ms additional latency)

**Compatibility Requirements** [Source: Epic 32 definition]:
- 100% frontend API compatibility - existing client applications require no changes
- Backward compatible with monolithic process during migration
- Support for hybrid deployment mode with gradual process extraction
- Message format compatibility with existing handler protocols

### Security Requirements
**Authentication & Authorization** [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]:
- AO message sender validation using wallet addresses
- Session security using ProcessAuthenticator multi-tier authentication
- Process-to-process communication secured with authentication tokens

- Session hijacking prevention through correlation tracking
- Concurrent session conflict resolution
- Session timeout and cleanup for security
- State integrity validation across distributed processes

### Project Structure Notes
The new coordinator process structure introduces a new top-level process directory under `ao-processes/coordinator/`, following the established pattern while extending it for multi-process architecture. This structure supports the gradual migration from monolithic to distributed architecture while maintaining clear separation of concerns. The coordinator acts as the primary entry point that can either handle operations directly (monolithic mode) or route them to specialized processes (distributed mode), enabling the hybrid deployment capability required by AC 6.
