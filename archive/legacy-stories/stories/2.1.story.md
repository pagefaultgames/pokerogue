2. Species forms and variants properly structured and queryable
3. Base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed) accurately stored
4. Type effectiveness data accessible for battle calculations
5. Species evolution chains and conditions preserved
6. Breeding compatibility data maintained for egg mechanics
7. Species rarity and encounter data available for spawn systems
8. Query handlers enable efficient species lookup by ID, name, or type
