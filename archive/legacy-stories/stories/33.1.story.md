## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**No previous Epic 33 stories completed:** This is the first story in Epic 33, building on the multi-process architecture foundation established in Epic 32. The comprehensive testing framework from Story 32.9 provides validation infrastructure that can be leveraged to verify timestamp migration maintains functional parity. The handler specialization patterns from Epic 32 provide the architectural foundation for systematic timestamp parameter threading.

**Key Architectural Patterns from Epic 32:**
- Handler-based message processing with specialized domain handlers
- Atomic state transaction patterns ensuring consistency during modifications
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure supporting parity validation
- Message protocol abstraction enabling systematic interface modifications

### Data Models
**Message Timestamp Model:** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md patterns]
- AO messages provide `msg.Timestamp` as standardized timestamp source for all operations
- Handler registration and response tracking requires timestamp data for audit trails
- Battle, player, and system state models include timestamp fields for progression tracking
- Error and logging models require timestamp integration for chronological event tracking

**Handler State Model:** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md patterns]  
- Handler registration timestamps track message processing lifecycle and timing
- Response message models include timestamp fields for client synchronization
- State persistence models maintain timestamp data for save/load operation tracking
- Audit trail models require precise timestamp integration for security and debugging

### API Specifications
**Handler Message Processing Pattern:** [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md]
```lua
-- Standard Handler Message Processing with Timestamp
Handlers.add(
    "HANDLER_NAME",
    Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag("Action", "HANDLER_ACTION"),
    function(msg)
        -- Extract timestamp at handler boundary
        local timestamp = msg.Timestamp
        if not timestamp then
            return { success = false, error = "Missing timestamp in message" }
        end
        
        -- Thread timestamp through internal processing
        local result = processHandlerLogic(msg.data, timestamp)
        
        -- Include timestamp in response
        return {
            success = true,
            data = result,
            timestamp = timestamp,
            processedAt = timestamp -- Use provided timestamp instead of os.time()
        }
    end
)
```

**Timestamp Parameter Threading Pattern:** [Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md patterns]
```lua
-- Internal Method Signature Updates
function processBattleLogic(battleData, timestamp)
    -- Use timestamp parameter instead of os.time()
    local currentTime = timestamp
    local battleResult = {
        outcome = calculateBattleOutcome(battleData, currentTime),
        processedAt = currentTime,
        nextTurnTime = currentTime + 30 -- Example timing calculation
    }
    return battleResult
end

-- Nested Method Threading
function calculateBattleOutcome(battleData, timestamp)
    -- Thread timestamp to nested calculations
    local damageResult = calculateDamage(battleData.attacker, battleData.defender, timestamp)
    local statusResult = applyStatusEffects(battleData.pokemon, battleData.effects, timestamp)
    
    return {
        damage = damageResult,
        status = statusResult,
        calculatedAt = timestamp
    }
end
```

- Integration tests: `ao-processes/tests/integration/timestamp-integration.test.lua` for cross-handler validation
- Performance tests: `ao-processes/tests/performance/timestamp-performance.test.lua` for parameter threading impact assessment

### Technical Constraints  
**AO Protocol Requirements:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- All handler modules must extract timestamp from `msg.Timestamp` at message boundaries
- Timestamp parameter threading must use native Lua function parameters for minimal performance impact
- Message processing must maintain AO message protocol compliance with timestamp integration
- Handler registration must follow established AO patterns while using provided timestamps

**Lua 5.3 Compatibility:** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Timestamp parameter threading must use standard Lua function parameter passing
- Integration with existing AO crypto module for deterministic operations requiring timestamps
- Compliance with existing Lua table-based state management using parameter timestamps
- Error handling must preserve timestamp context using established error propagation patterns

### Security Requirements
**Timestamp Validation:** [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
- All timestamp extractions require validation at handler boundaries before processing
- Timestamp parameter validation to prevent manipulation of timing-dependent logic
- Handler authentication operations must validate timestamp consistency and bounds
- Anti-cheat systems require secure timestamp handling to prevent timing-based exploits

**Input Validation:** [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
- Comprehensive validation of `msg.Timestamp` presence and format in all handlers
- Timestamp parameter validation in internal methods to prevent invalid time operations
- Error handling for missing or malformed timestamp data in message processing
- Security logging must include timestamp parameter validation results and any violations

### Project Structure Notes
**Structure Alignment:** The story aligns perfectly with the existing project structure. The `ao-processes/handlers/` directory contains exactly the 11 core handler modules specified in the Epic 33 requirements: battle-handler, admin-handler, shop-handler, berry-handler, query-handler, state-handler, auth-handler, validation-handler, anti-cheat-handler, inter-process-handler, and error-handler. The systematic timestamp migration approach builds naturally on the handler specialization patterns established in Epic 32. The existing testing framework provides comprehensive validation infrastructure for verifying timestamp migration maintains functional parity. No structural conflicts identified - the parameter threading approach preserves existing interfaces while enabling AO sandbox compatibility.
