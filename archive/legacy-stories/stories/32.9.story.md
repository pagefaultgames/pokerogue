### Project Structure Notes
**Structure Alignment:** The story aligns excellently with the existing project structure. The `ao-processes/tests/` directory already contains a comprehensive testing infrastructure with unit, integration, and performance testing capabilities. The testing framework includes advanced capabilities like parity testing, performance benchmarking, and aolite integration. The existing `scripts/test-ao-processes.sh` provides a foundation for comprehensive test execution that can be extended for Epic 32 validation. No structural conflicts identified - the comprehensive testing approach builds naturally on the established testing architecture and extends it for multi-process validation.
