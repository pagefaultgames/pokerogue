# Story 7.4: Player Character Progression

**Epic:** 7 - Player Progression & Experience Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-03  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **player progression specialist**,
I want **to track player statistics, achievements, and game completion status**,
so that **player progress through the game is recorded and persistent**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Player character data tracks name, gender, and appearance settings
2. Game progression tracking records gym badges, Elite Four, and Champion status
3. Pokédex completion tracking maintains seen/caught status for all species
4. Battle statistics record wins, losses, and battle participation
5. Money tracking maintains current balance with proper transaction logging
6. Play time tracking accumulates session time accurately
7. Player inventory management maintains items, TMs, and key items
8. Save data validation ensures player progress integrity and prevents corruption

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (7.3 - Friendship & Affection System):
- **Save Data Integration**: Friendship system successfully integrated with existing Pokemon state persistence - player progression system must extend this same state management pattern
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Friendship values maintain correctly across save/load cycles - player progress must follow identical persistence patterns
- **Data Model Integration**: Friendship system successfully integrated with existing Pokemon and Player data models - player progression extends existing Player model structure
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test framework established with unit tests and integration tests for state persistence - must extend for player progression tracking
- **Behavioral Parity**: All calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly using deterministic processing
- **State Validation**: Testing framework includes state validation across save/load cycles - player progression must implement identical validation patterns
