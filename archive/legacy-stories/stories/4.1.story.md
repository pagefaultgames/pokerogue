# Story 4.1: Turn-Based Battle Engine

**Epic:** 4 - Core Battle System & Turn Resolution  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-28  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **core battle system developer**,
I want **to implement the fundamental turn-based battle engine with proper turn order and action resolution**,
so that **battles execute identically to current game with correct speed calculations and priority handling**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Turn order determined by Pokémon speed stats with priority move handling
2. Speed tie resolution uses deterministic random number generation
3. Turn phases execute in correct order (command selection → action execution → end-of-turn effects)
4. Battle state transitions handled properly (active Pokémon, fainted Pokémon, etc.)
5. Multi-turn actions (charging moves, sleep, etc.) track duration correctly
6. Battle interruptions (fainting, switching) handled at appropriate times
7. Battle end conditions (all Pokémon fainted, forfeit) detected properly
8. Battle message generation matches current game output

## Project Structure Notes
The story requirements align perfectly with the established project structure. The Turn-Based Battle Engine builds directly on the comprehensive move system foundation from Stories 3.1-3.4, extends the existing battle architecture with turn-based logic, and follows the established patterns for handler organization in `ao-processes/handlers/` and game logic in `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/`. The implementation will create the missing `battle-handler.lua` and `turn-processor.lua` components while integrating with existing battle systems like `priority-calculator.lua`, `battle-conditions.lua`, and `pokemon-battle-integration.lua`. All file locations align with the defined source tree structure, maintaining consistency with existing battle mechanics while establishing the core turn-based foundation needed for complete battle functionality.
