**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As an **environmental effects developer**,
I want **to implement all weather conditions with proper battle effects**,
so that **weather changes battlefield conditions and affects move power, accuracy, and Pok√©mon abilities**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sun weather boosts fire move power by 50% and reduces water move power by 50%
2. Rain weather boosts water move power by 50% and reduces fire move power by 50%
3. Sandstorm weather damages non-Rock/Ground/Steel types for 1/16 max HP per turn
4. Hail weather damages non-Ice types for 1/16 max HP per turn
5. Weather duration tracking with proper turn countdown and renewal
6. Weather-related ability activations (Solar Power, Rain Dish, etc.) work correctly
7. Weather-dependent moves (Thunder, Solar Beam) have modified accuracy/power
8. Weather interactions with terrain and other field effects handled properly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic 5 completion (Story 5.1):
- **Complete Status Effects System** with all 5 major status conditions (sleep, poison, paralysis, burn, freeze), proper damage calculations (poison: 1/8 HP, burn: 1/16 HP), status interactions and mutual exclusivity rules, comprehensive healing system through moves/items/abilities, type and ability-based immunity validation, full integration with battle handler message processing, and deterministic RNG using AO crypto module [Source: docs/stories/5.1.story.md]

This provides the complete foundation for implementing weather effects with full integration into existing battle turn processing, damage calculations, battle state management, and environmental interaction systems established in Epic 4 and Story 5.1.

- Weather conditions must persist correctly across turns and battle conclusions
- Weather effect durations must maintain consistency during battle state transitions

**Data Integrity:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- Never hardcode Pokemon/Move/Ability data - always reference database tables for weather immunities and interactions
- Weather damage calculations must reference actual Pokemon HP and maxHP values for accurate percentage damage
- Maintain single source of truth for weather effect definitions and interaction rules
