# Story 4.2: Damage Calculation System

**Epic:** 4 - Core Battle System & Turn Resolution  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-28  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **battle mechanics specialist**,
I want **to implement precise damage calculation formulas matching current game exactly**,
so that **all battle outcomes are identical to TypeScript implementation**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Base damage formula accounts for level, attack/defense stats, and move power
2. Type effectiveness multipliers (0x, 0.25x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x) applied correctly
3. STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) provides 1.5x damage for matching types
4. Critical hit calculations use proper critical hit ratios and damage multipliers
5. Random damage variance (85%-100%) applied consistently
6. Stat stage modifications affect damage calculations correctly
7. Weather effects modify damage for appropriate move types
8. Ability and item effects modify damage calculations properly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 4.1 completion:
- Turn-based battle engine successfully implemented with comprehensive AO message handling and deterministic processing
- Battle state persistence system enables cross-turn damage calculation history tracking
- Integration with existing move systems from Stories 3.1-3.4 provides complete move effect and interaction foundation
- AO crypto module integration ensures deterministic random damage variance for reproducible battle outcomes
- Turn processor provides proper phase management for damage calculation timing within battle flow

### Data Models
**Pokemon Battle Stats:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pokemon-model]
- `stats`: table - Current battle stats [HP, ATK, DEF, SPATK, SPDEF, SPEED] for damage calculation formulas
- `level`: number - Current Pokemon level (1-100) used in base damage formula
- `nature`: string - Nature affecting stat growth, impacts attack/defense multipliers
- `battleData`: table - Temporary battle-specific data including stat stage modifications

**Battle State:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#battle-model]
- `battleSeed`: string - Deterministic RNG seed for consistent random damage variance
- `conditions`: table - Active field conditions and effects including weather for damage modification
- `turn`: number - Current battle turn for tracking damage calculation history

### Type Effectiveness System
**Type Chart Implementation:** [Source: ao-processes/data/constants/type-chart.lua]
- Multipliers: NO_EFFECT (0), EIGHTH_EFFECTIVE (0.125), QUARTER_EFFECTIVE (0.25), HALF_EFFECTIVE (0.5), NORMAL_EFFECTIVE (1), SUPER_EFFECTIVE (2), DOUBLE_SUPER_EFFECTIVE (4), OCTAL_SUPER_EFFECTIVE (8)
- Pokemon types from UNKNOWN (-1) through STELLAR (18) matching TypeScript PokemonType enum
- Complete type effectiveness matrix for accurate damage multiplier calculation

**Type Constants:** [Source: ao-processes/data/constants/enums.lua#pokemon-type]
- PokemonType enumeration with 19 types including STELLAR type
- Reverse lookup table PokemonTypeName for type number to name conversion
- STAB calculation requires matching Pokemon type with move type

### API Specifications
No specific API specifications found in architecture docs - damage calculation will integrate with existing battle handler message processing system established in Story 4.1.

### Component Specifications
**Damage Calculator Module:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#battle-mechanics]
- Location: `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/damage-calculator.lua` 
- Purpose: Damage formulas and type effectiveness calculations
- Integration: Called by turn processor during action execution phase
- Dependencies: Type chart data, Pokemon stats, move data, battle conditions

### File Locations
**Core Implementation:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Create `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/damage-calculator.lua` - Primary damage calculation system with formula implementation
- Extend `ao-processes/data/constants/type-chart.lua` - Type effectiveness matrix (already exists, may need enhancements)
- Extend `ao-processes/data/constants/enums.lua` - Damage-related constants and multipliers (already exists)

**Testing Files:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- Create `ao-processes/tests/unit/battle/damage-calculator.test.lua` - Unit tests for damage formulas with edge case coverage
- Create `ao-processes/tests/integration/damage-calculation-integration.test.lua` - Integration tests with complete battle scenarios

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- 100% coverage requirement for mathematical calculations including damage formulas
- AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) for all test functions  
- Mock external dependencies including RNG and database access
- Edge cases and error conditions systematic coverage

**Integration Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- Complete handler workflows including damage calculation within battle message processing
- In-memory test battle creation and cleanup for damage calculation scenarios
- State validation for damage calculation effects on Pokemon HP and battle state

**Parity Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Parity-First Test-Driven Development - validate all damage calculations against TypeScript reference
- 100% behavioral parity validation required before implementation acceptance
- Heavy integration testing for game mechanics including damage calculation workflows

### Technical Constraints
**Deterministic Calculations:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- Never use Lua's math.random() - ALWAYS use AO crypto module for random damage variance
- Battle RNG counter must increment for every random call including damage variance rolls
- All stat calculations must match TypeScript Math.floor/Math.ceil exactly for identical damage values
- Nature multipliers must be exactly 0.9, 1.0, or 1.1 - never approximate for precise damage calculation

**Mathematical Precision:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All damage calculations must match TypeScript implementation exactly
- Critical hit ratios and damage multipliers must use identical mathematical precision
- Stat stage modifications must apply exact multipliers without floating point approximation errors

**Data Integrity:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- Never hardcode Pokemon/Move/Item data - always reference database tables for move power and Pokemon stats
- All AO message responses must include success boolean for damage calculation errors
- Maintain single source of truth for type effectiveness and damage modification data
