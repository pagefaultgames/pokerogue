# Story 7.2: Pokémon Evolution System

**Epic:** 7 - Player Progression & Experience Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-02  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **evolution specialist**,
I want **to implement all evolution methods and conditions with proper triggering**,
so that **Pokémon evolve using identical conditions and timing to current game**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Level-based evolution triggers at correct levels during level-up process
2. Stone-based evolution validates item usage and species compatibility
3. Trade-based evolution handles evolution conditions properly
4. Friendship-based evolution checks friendship thresholds and timing conditions
5. Time-based evolution considers day/night cycles and time restrictions
6. Location-based evolution validates current biome/area requirements
7. Move-based evolution checks known moves during evolution trigger
8. Evolution cancellation (pressing B) prevents unwanted evolution properly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (7.1 - Experience & Leveling System):
- **Evolution System Foundation**: A basic evolution system was created in `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/evolution-system.lua` with level-based evolution checking
- **Integration Pattern**: Evolution system integrated with experience system and battle handler through the `checkLevelEvolution()` function
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test framework established with unit tests and integration tests - must extend existing test suites
- **Behavioral Parity**: All evolution calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly using deterministic processing
- **Data Dependencies**: Evolution chain data established in `ao-processes/data/species/evolution-chains.lua` - migrate complete dataset from TypeScript reference covering all 900+ Pokemon species and all evolution condition types

### Data Models
**Pokemon Model Evolution Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pokemon-model]:
- `speciesId`: string - Species identifier from SpeciesId enum
- `level`: number - Current Pokemon level for evolution conditions
- `friendship`: number - Friendship level for friendship-based evolution
- `gender`: string - Gender for gender-specific evolutions
- `heldItem`: string|nil - Currently held item for item-based evolution
- `moves`: table - Array of known moves for move-based evolution requirements
- `evolutionHistory`: table - Evolution tracking for validation

**Battle Model Evolution Context** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#battle-model]:
- `battleSeed`: string - Deterministic RNG seed for evolution randomness
- `battleType`: string - Battle context that may affect evolution conditions
- `turn`: number - Battle timing for time-sensitive evolution triggers

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints found in architecture docs for evolution system - system will integrate with existing Pokemon State Manager and battle resolution handler.

### Component Specifications
**Pokemon State Manager Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#pokemon-state-manager]:
- `evolvePokemon(pokemonId, evolutionId)` - Evolution processing with stat recalculation
- `createPokemon(speciesId, level, ivs, nature)` - Pokemon instantiation may need evolution form handling
- `recalculateStats(pokemonId)` - Stat recalculation after evolution with new base stats

**Battle Resolution Handler Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#battle-resolution-handler]:
- `processBattleTurn(battleCommand)` - Battle context for evolution conditions (trade, item usage)
- Evolution triggers may occur during battle resolution or post-battle processing

## Project Structure Notes
File locations align with existing project structure from `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.
