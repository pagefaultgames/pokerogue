### Project Structure Notes
The new Pokemon process structure extracts existing Pokemon logic from `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/` into a dedicated process under `ao-processes/pokemon/`. This maintains the existing Pokemon system architecture while enabling process isolation and optimized Pokemon operations. The pokemon process integrates with the coordinator and battle processes through the established inter-process communication framework, maintaining 100% API compatibility while enabling improved performance through dedicated Pokemon processing resources. The extraction preserves all existing Pokemon mechanics, stat calculations, and evolution systems to ensure zero regression in Pokemon functionality.
