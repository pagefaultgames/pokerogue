### Project Structure Notes
The new economic process structure extracts existing shop and berry systems from `ao-processes/game-logic/items/` and `ao-processes/handlers/` into a dedicated process under `ao-processes/economy/`. This maintains the existing economic system architecture while enabling process isolation and concurrent economic processing. The economic process integrates with the coordinator and Pokemon processes through the established inter-process communication framework, maintaining 100% behavioral parity while enabling improved performance through dedicated economic processing resources. The extraction preserves all existing shop mechanics, berry effects, and item management operations to ensure zero regression in economic functionality.
