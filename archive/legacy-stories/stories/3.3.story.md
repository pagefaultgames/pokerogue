# Story 3.3: Move Effect System Architecture

**Epic:** 3 - Move System & Battle Actions  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-28  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **game engine architect**,
I want **to create a flexible move effect system supporting all special move behaviors**,
so that **complex moves like Metronome, Transform, and weather moves function correctly**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Status effect application (sleep, poison, paralysis, etc.) works correctly
2. Stat stage changes (+1/-1 Attack, Defense, etc.) apply properly
3. Weather-changing moves modify battlefield conditions
4. Terrain-setting moves affect battle environment
5. Healing moves restore HP according to formulas
6. Recoil moves damage user appropriately after dealing damage
7. Multi-turn moves (Fly, Dig, etc.) handle charging and execution phases
8. Random effect moves (Metronome, Sleep Talk) select effects properly

## Project Structure Notes
The story requirements align perfectly with the established project structure in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. The Move Effect System Architecture builds directly on the existing move-effects.lua foundation from previous stories, extending the battle system with comprehensive weather, terrain, status, and stat modification systems. The implementation follows the established patterns for game-logic organization, with battle-specific effects in the battle/ directory, data structures in the data/battle/ directory, and comprehensive testing in the tests/unit/battle/ and tests/integration/ directories. All file locations align with the defined source tree structure, maintaining consistency with existing battle mechanics and handler patterns. The move effect system integrates seamlessly with the established Battle Resolution Handler and Pokemon State Manager components while extending their capabilities for complex battle interactions.

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDING: Story incomplete with 50% of core functionality missing**

The implemented move effects system demonstrates excellent architectural foundation with Tasks 1-5 fully completed and well-tested. However, Tasks 6-8 (recoil, multi-turn, random effects) remain unimplemented despite being marked as "Ready For Review." This represents 3/8 acceptance criteria missing implementation.

**Positive aspects:**
- Excellent status effect system with comprehensive immunity and interaction handling
- Robust stat stage modification with precise TypeScript parity and ability interactions  
- Complete weather/terrain systems with proper damage calculations and healing modifications
- Solid test architecture with 730+ lines of comprehensive unit tests covering implemented features
- Strong adherence to coding standards including deterministic RNG usage and proper validation

**Critical gaps:**
- Recoil damage system (AC 6) - Function stub exists but incomplete
- Multi-turn move system (AC 7) - No semi-invulnerable state handling implemented
- Random effect moves (AC 8) - Metronome and Sleep Talk systems completely missing

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to incomplete implementation preventing safe code modifications. Story requires development completion before optimization can be conducted.
