# Epic 34: Complete Implementation Plan

## üéØ Overview

This plan provides step-by-step execution for Epic 34 with corrected tool integration (aos-local + aolite) and immediate bundle crisis resolution.

## üö® PHASE 0: Critical Bundle Crisis Resolution (IMMEDIATE)

**Goal:** Unblock AO deployment within 24 hours

### Step 1: Bundle Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current bundle bloat
./scripts/analyze-bundle-bloat.sh

# Expected findings: 88√ó enum duplications, 60√ó process-coordination duplications
```

### Step 2: Bundle Optimization
```bash
# Fix duplications with shared module pool  
./scripts/optimize-bundle-duplicates.sh

# Expected: 70-90% size reduction
```

### Step 3: Deployment Validation
```bash
# Validate 500KB limits
./scripts/validate-bundle-sizes.sh build-optimized

# If still oversized:
./scripts/emergency-bundle-split.sh build-optimized
```

### Step 4: Emergency Deployment
```bash
# Deploy optimized/split bundles to AO
# Test basic functionality
# Confirm deployment success
```

**Success Criteria:** All processes deploy successfully to AO network

## ‚ö° PHASE 1: Testing Foundation (Days 1-3)

**Goal:** Establish aos-local + aolite development environment

### Story 34.1: aos-local Development Environment

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Complete environment setup
./scripts/setup-epic34-environment.sh
```

**Installs:**
- Node.js ‚â•18 with `--experimental-wasm-memory64`
- `@permaweb/loco` package for aos-local JavaScript API
- Lua 5.3 + luarocks
- `aolite` package for concurrent testing
- Development helpers and scripts

#### Step 2: aos-local Development Workflow
```bash
# Start handler development session
./scripts/epic34-dev-workflow.sh develop ao-processes/handlers/battle-handler.lua

# Test handler interactively
node scripts/aos-local-dev.js test '{"Action":"Ping"}'

# Inspect process state
node scripts/aos-local-dev.js state GameState
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] aos-local installed and configured
- [x] Local process spawning works
- [x] Handler development workflow established
- [x] State inspection tools available

### Story 34.2: aolite Concurrent Process Testing

#### Step 1: aolite Installation Verification
```bash
# Verify aolite installation
lua -e "require('aolite'); print('aolite ready')"
```

#### Step 2: Multi-Process Testing Setup
```lua
-- Example: Multi-process spawning
local aolite = require("aolite")

aolite.spawnProcess("coordinator", "./build-optimized/coordinator-process.lua")
aolite.spawnProcess("battle", "./build-optimized/battle-process.lua")

-- Test inter-process communication
aolite.send({
    From = "coordinator",
    Target = "battle", 
    Action = "Initialize-Battle",
    BattleId = "test-001"
})
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] aolite package installed (Lua 5.3)
- [x] Multi-process spawning capability
- [x] Message queue management
- [x] Process lifecycle control

---

## üîß PHASE 2: Comprehensive Testing (Days 4-7)

### Story 34.3: aolite Unit Testing Framework

#### Step 1: Unit Test Creation
```bash
# Create unit tests for each handler
# Examples provided:
# - ao-processes/tests/unit/example-battle-handler.test.lua
# - ao-processes/tests/framework/aolite-test-runner.lua
```

#### Step 2: Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific unit tests
./scripts/epic34-dev-workflow.sh test-unit battle-handler

# Run all unit tests
./scripts/run-epic34-tests.sh unit
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Individual handler testing framework
- [x] Mock message generation utilities
- [x] State assertion helpers
- [x] Error condition testing
- [x] Performance benchmarking

### Story 34.4: aolite Multi-Process Integration Testing

#### Step 1: Integration Test Development
```bash
# Multi-process integration tests
# Example: ao-processes/tests/integration/example-multi-process.test.lua
```

#### Step 2: End-to-End Workflow Testing
```bash
# Test complete game scenarios
./scripts/run-epic34-tests.sh integration
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Multi-process communication testing
- [x] End-to-end game scenarios
- [x] State consistency validation
- [x] Error propagation testing
- [x] Process synchronization tests

## üìà PHASE 3: Production Readiness (Days 8-10)

### Story 34.5: Load and Performance Testing

```bash
# Performance testing with aolite
./scripts/run-epic34-tests.sh performance
```

### Story 34.6: CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: Epic 34 Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Epic 34 Environment
        run: ./scripts/setup-epic34-environment.sh
      - name: Run Test Suite  
        run: ./scripts/run-epic34-tests.sh
      - name: Validate Bundle Sizes
        run: ./scripts/validate-bundle-sizes.sh
```
