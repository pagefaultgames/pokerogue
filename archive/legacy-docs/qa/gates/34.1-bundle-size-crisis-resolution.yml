# Quality Gate Decision for Story 34.1
schema: 1
story: "34.1"
story_title: "Bundle Size Crisis Resolution"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical deployment objectives unachieved - bundles remain significantly oversized despite optimization tooling implementation."

top_issues:
  - id: "DEPLOY-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Battle process bundle remains 1.0MB after optimization, exceeding AO 500KB limit by 512KB"
    suggested_action: "Implement architectural bundle splitting or significant code reduction strategies"
  - id: "DEPLOY-002" 
    severity: high
    finding: "Pokemon process bundle at 735KB exceeds AO deployment limit by 223KB"
    suggested_action: "Apply successful optimization techniques to reduce pokemon process size"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Missing actual AO network deployment validation for AC5"
    suggested_action: "Add end-to-end deployment testing against AO network"
  - id: "DOC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Bundle management workflow documentation not delivered as standalone deliverable"
    suggested_action: "Create dedicated workflow documentation file as specified in AC7"

  recommendations:
    must_fix: 
      - "Resolve bundle size violations before AO deployment"
      - "Implement effective bundle splitting or architectural optimization"
    monitor:
      - "Bundle optimization tool effectiveness over time"
      - "Emergency splitting strategy improvements"
