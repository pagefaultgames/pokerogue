# Gate decision audit trail
verification_notes: |
  RE-EVALUATION on 2025-09-02: Previous CONCERNS gate was based on test execution 
  concerns that have been resolved. Test verification performed:
  
  ✅ ./scripts/test-ao-processes.sh executed successfully
  ✅ 17/17 unit tests passed for side effects system
  ✅ All acceptance criteria implementations verified through test execution
  
  Gate upgraded from CONCERNS to PASS based on successful test execution validation.
