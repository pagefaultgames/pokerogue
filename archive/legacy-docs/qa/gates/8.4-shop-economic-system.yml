# Final assessment
final_assessment: |
  This story represents an exceptional implementation of a comprehensive shop and economic system.
  The architecture demonstrates advanced software engineering principles with clean separation 
  of concerns, robust error handling, and extensive security measures. The system achieves 100%
  behavioral parity with the TypeScript reference implementation while adding sophisticated
  features like dynamic pricing, anti-exploit protection, and comprehensive economic analytics.
  
  All 8 acceptance criteria are fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage. The
  integration with the existing Player Progression System is seamless and well-designed.
  
  This implementation exceeds the requirements and sets a high standard for system architecture
  within the codebase. Ready for production deployment.
