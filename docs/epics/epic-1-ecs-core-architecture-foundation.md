# Epic 1: ECS Core Architecture Foundation

## Epic Goal
Implement pure Entity-Component-System architecture foundation with archetype-based storage, component registration, and type safety to establish the performance-optimized core for PokÃ©Rogue's HyperBeam engine.

## Context and Scope
**Project Type:** Greenfield ECS Architecture  
**Integration Impact:** Foundation - all other epics depend on this core  
**Performance Impact:** Cache-optimized entity storage with SIMD-ready data layouts

## Story 1.1: Entity Manager and ID System
As an **ECS architect**,
I want **a high-performance entity creation and management system**,
so that **entities can be efficiently created, destroyed, and queried with stable IDs**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Entity ID generation using sparse set architecture for O(1) operations
2. Entity lifecycle management with creation, destruction, and reuse
3. Component archetype tracking for cache-efficient queries
4. Memory-efficient sparse set implementation for entity-component relationships
5. Entity validation and integrity checking
6. Batch entity operations for improved performance
7. Entity metadata tracking (creation time, generation, etc.)
8. Zero-cost abstractions for entity handle management

## Story 1.2: Component Registration and Type System
As an **component system developer**,
I want **a type-safe component registration system with reflection capabilities**,
so that **components can be dynamically registered and queried with compile-time safety**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Component type registration with unique type IDs
2. Component metadata extraction (size, alignment, constructor/destructor)
3. Type-safe component access patterns
4. Dynamic component discovery and introspection
5. Component versioning for serialization compatibility
6. Memory layout optimization for component types
7. Component dependency tracking and validation
8. Hot-reloading support for component type changes

## Story 1.3: Archetype Storage System
As a **performance optimization specialist**,
I want **archetype-based component storage with cache-efficient memory layouts**,
so that **system iterations achieve maximum cache locality and SIMD optimization potential**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Archetype creation and management based on component signatures
2. Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) memory layout for component data
3. Cache-line aligned memory allocations for optimal access patterns
4. Dynamic archetype transitions when components are added/removed
5. Memory pool management for archetype storage efficiency
6. Archetype iteration patterns optimized for modern CPU architectures
7. Memory defragmentation and compaction for long-running systems
8. Performance benchmarking demonstrating cache efficiency gains

## Story 1.4: Query System and Iterators
As a **system implementation developer**,
I want **flexible and fast entity queries with type-safe iterators**,
so that **systems can efficiently process entities with specific component combinations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Type-safe query builder API for component filtering
2. Optimized query execution using archetype iteration
3. Query caching and reuse for repeated patterns
4. Support for include, exclude, and optional component filters
5. Parallel iteration support for multi-threaded systems
6. Query compilation and optimization for hot paths
7. Memory-efficient query result storage and iteration
8. Integration with change detection for reactive systems

## Story 1.5: Change Detection and Events
As a **reactive system architect**,
I want **efficient change detection and event propagation for components**,
so that **systems can react to component modifications without polling**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Component modification tracking with versioning
2. Event generation for component add/remove/modify operations
3. Efficient change detection using generation counters
4. Event batching and deduplication for performance
5. System ordering based on change detection dependencies
6. Memory-efficient change tracking for large entity counts
7. Integration with query system for reactive updates
8. Event filtering and routing for targeted system notifications
