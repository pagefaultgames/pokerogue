### Acceptance Criteria
1. Minimal ECS runtime for AO Lua environment
2. Component storage within AO memory limits
3. System execution optimized for AO computational constraints
4. Query processing within AO performance bounds
5. Event handling for AO message-driven updates
6. Memory management for long-running AO processes
7. Integration with AO scheduler and message queuing
8. Functionality validation in AO sandbox environment

## Story 3.5: Cross-Process ECS Communication
As a **multi-process coordination architect**,
I want **ECS entity sharing and communication across AO processes**,
so that **distributed game systems can coordinate through ECS abstractions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Entity reference sharing between AO processes
2. Component replication and synchronization protocols
3. Cross-process query execution and result aggregation
4. Distributed system execution with process boundaries
5. Inter-process event propagation and handling
6. Process discovery and capability negotiation
7. Load balancing for distributed ECS operations
8. Fault tolerance for process failures and network issues

## Story 3.6: Blockchain Event Integration
As a **blockchain event processor**,
I want **AO blockchain events integrated into ECS event system**,
so that **on-chain transactions can trigger responsive ECS system updates**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. AO transaction monitoring and event extraction
2. Blockchain event filtering and routing to relevant systems
3. Transaction confirmation handling with rollback support
4. Event ordering and causality preservation
5. Integration with ECS change detection system
6. Performance optimization for high-frequency blockchain events
