# Epic 7: ECS Deployment & Operations

## Epic Goal
Implement robust deployment, monitoring, and operational management systems for ECS HyperBeam architecture with AO integration, ensuring reliable production operations and seamless updates.

## Context and Scope
**Project Type:** Production Operations and Deployment  
**Integration Impact:** Production environment - all deployment and operational concerns  
**Performance Impact:** Operational efficiency with zero-downtime deployments

## Story 7.1: ECS Process Bundling and Packaging
As a **deployment engineer**,
I want **optimized ECS process bundling with minimal size and maximum performance**,
so that **AO deployments are efficient and stay within protocol constraints**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. ECS component and system bundling optimized for AO size limits
2. Dead code elimination and tree-shaking for production builds
3. Component data compression and serialization optimization
4. Multi-target bundling for different AO process specializations
5. Bundle validation and integrity checking before deployment
6. Incremental bundling for faster development iterations
7. Bundle size analytics and optimization recommendations
8. Target: <500KB bundles with full ECS functionality

## Story 7.2: Entity State Persistence and Recovery
As a **data persistence specialist**,
I want **reliable entity state persistence with fast recovery capabilities**,
so that **game state survives process restarts and system failures**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Entity state snapshot creation with component serialization
2. Incremental state updates for efficient persistence
3. State recovery and restoration with integrity validation
4. Backup and archival systems for long-term state preservation
5. State migration tools for component schema evolution
6. Performance optimization for large-scale entity persistence
7. Integration with AO blockchain for immutable state anchoring
8. Recovery time target: <10 seconds for typical game states

## Story 7.3: System Health Monitoring and Metrics
As a **system reliability engineer**,
I want **comprehensive health monitoring and performance metrics for ECS systems**,
so that **system issues can be detected and resolved proactively**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time system health dashboards with key performance indicators
2. ECS-specific metrics: entity counts, system execution times, memory usage
3. Alert systems for performance degradation and system failures
4. Historical trend analysis and capacity planning insights
5. Integration with external monitoring platforms (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
6. Custom metric definition and collection for domain-specific monitoring
7. Automated health checks and system validation
8. Monitoring overhead target: <1% performance impact

## Story 7.4: Zero-Downtime Deployment System
As a **deployment automation engineer**,
I want **zero-downtime deployment capabilities with rollback support**,
so that **ECS systems can be updated without service interruption**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Blue-green deployment strategy for ECS processes
2. Rolling updates with health checking and automatic rollback
3. State migration during deployments with consistency guarantees
4. Deployment validation and smoke testing automation
5. Rollback mechanisms with state restoration capabilities
6. Deployment coordination across multiple AO processes
7. Integration with continuous integration and delivery pipelines
8. Deployment time target: <5 minutes with zero service interruption

## Story 7.5: Multi-Environment Management
As a **environment management specialist**,
I want **consistent multi-environment deployment and configuration management**,
so that **development, staging, and production environments remain synchronized**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Environment-specific configuration management with validation
2. Automated environment provisioning and teardown
3. Environment synchronization and data migration tools
4. Configuration drift detection and remediation
5. Environment isolation and security boundary enforcement
6. Integration with infrastructure-as-code tools and practices
7. Environment promotion workflows with approval gates
8. Environment consistency validation and compliance checking

## Story 7.6: Operational Automation and Maintenance
As an **operations automation engineer**,
I want **automated operational tasks and maintenance procedures**,
so that **routine operations can be performed reliably without manual intervention**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated backup and restoration procedures
2. System maintenance scheduling and execution
3. Performance optimization automation based on system metrics
4. Capacity scaling automation based on load patterns
5. Security patch application and vulnerability management
6. Log rotation, archival, and cleanup automation
7. Incident response automation and alerting workflows
8. Operational runbook automation and documentation
