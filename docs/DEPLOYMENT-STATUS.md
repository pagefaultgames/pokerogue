# AO Process Deployment Status

## 🚧 Current Status: Manual Deployment Required

The deployment scripts have been created and updated to use `aos` instead of `permamind`, but **automated deployment currently requires manual intervention** due to AOS interactive prompts.

## 🔍 Issues Found

### Issue 1: AOS Interactive Prompts
- **Problem**: AOS CLI shows an interactive prompt asking to choose between `aos` and `hyper-aos`
- **Impact**: Automated scripts get stuck waiting for user input
- **Status**: Needs resolution

### Issue 2: Process ID Extraction
- **Problem**: Need to verify the format of AOS process IDs in output
- **Impact**: Scripts may not correctly extract process IDs after successful deployment
- **Status**: Needs testing with manual deployment

## 📋 Current Deployment Commands

✅ **Available (but require manual intervention):**
- `npm run ao:build` - Build all processes (works correctly)
- `npm run ao:deploy` - Deploy all processes (gets stuck on AOS prompts)
- `npm run ao:deploy:single <name>` - Deploy single process (gets stuck on AOS prompts)
- `npm run ao:guide` - Show deployment guide (works correctly)

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Workflow

Until automated deployment is fixed, use this manual process:

### 1. Build Processes
```bash
npm run ao:build
```

### 2. Manual Deployment (Per Process)
For each process (coordinator, admin, security, battle, pokemon, economy):

```bash
# Start AOS and select 'aos' when prompted
aos <process-name>-process --load build/<process-name>-process.lua

# This will:
# 1. Show AOS ascii art
# 2. Prompt you to select 'aos' or 'hyper-aos' - choose 'aos'
# 3. Load and spawn the process
# 4. Give you a process ID

# Send a test message to verify it's working
Info

# Exit the AOS session
.exit
```

### 3. Record Process IDs
Keep track of the process IDs returned by each deployment for later reference.

## 🎯 Solutions Needed

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Preferred)
Find or request an AOS environment variable that skips interactive prompts:
```bash
export AOS_NON_INTERACTIVE=true
# or similar
```

### Option 2: Expect Script
Create an expect script to automatically handle the interactive prompts:
```bash
expect -c "
    spawn aos process-name --load bundle.lua
    expect \"Please select\"
    send \"\r\"
    expect \"Info\"
    send \".exit\r\"
    expect eof
"
```

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Method
Research if there are other AO deployment tools or methods that don't require interactive prompts.

## 📊 Build System Status

✅ **Working correctly:**
- Process bundling with harlequin
- Build manifest generation
- Individual process builds
- Build validation

❌ **Needs fixing:**
- Automated process deployment
- Health check automation
- Process ID extraction and tracking

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Research AOS non-interactive deployment options
2. Implement expect-based automation if needed
3. Test process ID extraction with manual deployments
4. Update health check mechanisms
5. Verify inter-process communication after deployment

## 📁 Key Files

- `build/multi-process-manifest.json` - Build status (✅ working)
- `scripts/deploy-bundled-processes-simple.sh` - Main deployment script (⚠️ needs manual intervention)
- `scripts/deploy-single-process.sh` - Single process deployment (⚠️ needs manual intervention)
- `scripts/deployment-guide.sh` - User guide (✅ working)

## 💡 Temporary Workaround

For immediate testing and development:
1. Use `npm run ao:build` to build all processes
2. Deploy manually using the workflow above
3. Use process IDs for direct AOS interaction
4. Test functionality manually until automation is fixed
