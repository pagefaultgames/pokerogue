## Project Structure Notes
File locations align perfectly with existing project structure from `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. The side effect system will be implemented building on the existing battle conditions system (`ao-processes/game-logic/battle/battle-conditions.lua`) and damage calculator system (`ao-processes/game-logic/battle/damage-calculator.lua`) which provides the foundation for damage reduction calculations. The implementation extends the established architecture patterns while integrating seamlessly with existing battle handler from Story 4.1, damage calculator from Story 4.2, battle state management from Story 4.3, victory/defeat system from Story 4.4, status effects system from Story 5.1, weather system from Story 5.2, terrain system from Story 5.3, environmental interactions from Story 5.4, entry hazards system from Story 6.1, and field conditions system from Story 6.2. The system leverages existing environmental precedence system and integrates with the comprehensive field effect management already established.
