# Story 3.1: Move Database & Mechanics Migration

**Epic:** 3 - Move System & Battle Actions  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-28  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **battle mechanics developer**,
I want **to migrate all 900+ moves with their complete effect definitions to AO handlers**,
so that **every move functions identically to the current game with proper damage, accuracy, and effect calculations**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All moves migrated with accurate power, accuracy, PP, and type data
2. Move categories (Physical, Special, Status) properly classified
3. Move targets (Single, All, Allies, etc.) correctly implemented
4. Move flags (Contact, Sound, Bullet, etc.) preserved for ability interactions
5. Move effects (damage, status infliction, stat changes) function correctly
6. Multi-hit moves handle hit count variation properly
7. Priority moves execute in correct speed order
8. Critical hit calculations match current game formulas

### Testing Requirements
**Parity-First Testing Philosophy:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#testing-philosophy]
- Every move's damage, accuracy, and effect calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly
- 100% behavioral parity validation for all move effects including status conditions and stat modifications
- Heavy integration testing for complete battle move execution from command to resolution
- 95%+ code coverage requirement for all move-related battle calculations and effect processing

**Test Types and Organization:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#test-types-and-organization]
- **Unit Tests:** Individual move data validation, damage calculation precision, accuracy formula testing, effect application verification
- **Integration Tests:** Complete move execution workflows including multi-hit moves, priority handling, and effect interactions
- **End-to-End Tests:** Full battle scenarios with move combinations, critical hits, and status effect interactions

**AI Agent Test Requirements:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Generate comprehensive tests for all 900+ moves following AAA pattern with TypeScript comparison
- Cover edge cases including zero-power moves, perfect accuracy moves, and multi-hit variations
- Mock battle conditions while validating complete integration with Pokemon stats and abilities
- Test move effect combinations and interaction priorities for complex battle scenarios

### Technical Constraints
**Damage Calculation Precision:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All damage calculations must use precise mathematical functions matching TypeScript Math.floor/Math.ceil behavior
- Critical hit multipliers must be exactly 1.5x with proper integer rounding matching original formulas
- Type effectiveness must use exact decimal multipliers (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0) without approximation
- Multi-hit move damage must calculate each hit separately with proper randomization using AO crypto module

**Random Number Generation:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Never use Lua's math.random() - ALWAYS use AO crypto module for all move-related randomness
- Critical hit determination, accuracy rolls, and multi-hit counts must use deterministic seeded RNG
- Battle RNG counter must increment for every random call ensuring deterministic battle replay capability
- Effect application randomness (sleep duration, confusion turns) must use proper AO crypto integration

**Data Storage Requirements:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- Embedded Lua structures for move database ensuring AO process independence and fast lookup
- In-process Lua tables for move effect state with clear organization and efficient access patterns
- Self-contained move data preventing external dependencies and maintaining data consistency

**Message Protocol Compliance:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- JSON message protocol for all move-related operations ensuring AOConnect compatibility
- Custom Lua schemas for move data validation with proper type safety and error handling
- Native AO Handlers framework integration for optimal move processing performance

### Security Requirements
**Input Validation:** [Source: architecture/security.md#input-validation]
- All move IDs must be validated against move database before any processing or battle execution
- Move target validation ensuring only legal targets can be selected for each move type
- Battle participation validation ensuring only active Pokemon can use moves in current battle
- Whitelist approach for all move parameters preventing impossible move combinations or effects

**Battle State Integrity:** [Source: architecture/security.md#game-state-integrity]
- Move execution must maintain battle state consistency preventing impossible battle conditions
- Atomic message processing ensures partial move effects cannot corrupt battle state
- Move effect validation ensuring only legal combinations and durations are applied
- Priority order calculation must be deterministic and tamper-resistant for fair battle resolution

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The move system implementation demonstrates strong architectural foundations with well-structured, modular components. The code follows TypeScript parity patterns and implements comprehensive functionality including move effects, priority calculations, critical hits, and query handling. However, significant concerns exist regarding implementation completeness and documentation accuracy.

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed during this review** - The codebase architecture is sound and follows established patterns. The primary issues are related to completeness and documentation accuracy rather than code quality.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Code follows established Lua patterns and maintains consistency with existing codebase
- **Project Structure**: ✗ **File List contains major inaccuracies** - Listed files don't match filesystem reality  
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests covering all major functionality
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria are covered by implementation, though with reduced scope (21 moves vs claimed 900+)

### Improvements Checklist

[**HIGH PRIORITY - Must Address**]
- [ ] **Reconcile File List accuracy** - Update story to reflect actual implementation locations or create missing files as claimed
- [ ] **Complete TODO placeholders** - Finish integration components in move-effects.lua and other battle system files
- [ ] **Clarify move database scope** - Either populate full 900+ moves or update story claims to reflect actual 21-move implementation

[**COMPLETED DURING IMPLEMENTATION**]
- [x] Complete move effects system with status conditions and stat modifications

[**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**]
- [ ] Expand move database to full dataset for production readiness
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks with complete move set
- [ ] Implement remaining TODO items for full battle system integration

### Security Review

**PASS** - Implementation follows secure coding practices with proper input validation, no exposed secrets, and defensive error handling patterns.

### Performance Considerations

**CONCERNS** - Performance tests exist but limited to 21-move dataset. Real-world performance with full move database unknown. Current implementation shows good algorithmic patterns but needs validation at scale.

### Files Modified During Review

**None** - No code changes made during review process. Issues identified are architectural and documentation-related.

### Gate Status
