# Story 8.3: Berry System & Effects

**Epic:** 8 - Item & Modifier Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-03  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **berry mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement the complete berry system with proper activation conditions**,
so that **berries provide automatic healing and status curing with correct triggering**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. HP-restoring berries activate at 25% or 50% HP thresholds appropriately
2. Status-curing berries activate immediately upon receiving corresponding status
3. Stat-boosting berries activate when corresponding stat is lowered
4. Damage-reducing berries halve super-effective damage once per battle
5. Berry consumption removes berry from held item slot after activation
6. Pinch berries (Petaya, Salac, etc.) activate at 25% HP with correct stat boost
7. Type-resist berries (Occa, Shuca, etc.) reduce damage by 50% once per battle
8. Berry recycling through moves and abilities functions correctly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (8.2 - Held Item System):
- **Item Database Foundation**: Complete item database established with 165+ items across all categories including 12 berry types - berry system can leverage this extensive database
- **Item Effects Infrastructure**: ItemEffectsProcessor system provides comprehensive effect processing with deterministic calculations using AO crypto module - berry system must extend this for activation conditions and timing
- **Inventory Integration**: InventoryManager handles item acquisition, removal, and persistence - berry system must integrate for consumption and removal after activation
- **Pokemon State Integration**: System successfully integrated with existing Pokemon State Manager for stat calculations - berry system must integrate for HP threshold monitoring and stat modifications
- **Battle System Integration**: Battle Resolution Handler integration established for item usage - berries must integrate for automatic activation during battle turns
- **Held Item Integration**: Held item assignment system established with Pokemon heldItem field - berry system leverages this existing infrastructure for berry assignment and consumption
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit and integration test framework established with 100% coverage - berry system must follow identical testing patterns
- **Behavioral Parity**: All calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly using deterministic processing with AO crypto module for RNG
- **Coding Standards Compliance**: Enforced AO crypto module usage (never math.random()) and proper error handling patterns - berry system must maintain identical compliance

### Data Models

- `heldItem`: string|nil - Currently held item identifier for Pokemon (berries use this slot)
- `hp`: number - Current hit points for berry activation threshold monitoring
- `maxHp`: number - Maximum hit points for percentage calculation (25%, 50%)
- `statusEffect`: string|nil - Current status condition for berry activation trigger
- `stats`: table - Current battle stats for stat-boosting berry modifications
- `battleData`: table - Temporary battle-specific data including berry activation tracking

**Player Model Inventory Integration** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]:

- Berry activation handler for automatic triggering based on conditions
- Berry assignment handler integrated with existing held item system
- Berry consumption handler for removal after activation
- Berry query handler for berry status and availability checking

### Component Specifications

- `applyStatModifiers(pokemon, modifiers)` - Precise berry modifier application for stat-boosting berries
- `createPokemon(speciesId, level, ivs, nature)` - Pokemon instantiation with berry slot initialization

**Battle Resolution Handler Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#battle-resolution-handler]:
- `processBattleTurn(battleCommand)` - Main battle logic entry point for berry activation monitoring
- `calculateDamage(attacker, defender, move)` - Damage calculation with berry damage reduction effects
- `applyStatusEffects(pokemon, effects)` - Status condition application triggering status-curing berries
- `validateBattleState(battleId, expectedHash)` - Battle state consistency verification including berry states

**Game State Coordinator Integration** [Source: architecture/components.md#game-state-coordinator]:
- `saveGameState(playerId, gameData)` - Complete game state serialization including berry assignments and activation states
- `loadGameState(playerId)` - Game state restoration with berry validation and activation tracking
- `updateProgression(playerId, progressData)` - Berry acquisition tracking for progression milestones

- `queryBattleState(battleId, queryType)` - Current battle information including active berry effects and activation status
- `queryAvailableActions(battleId, playerId)` - Valid actions considering berry effects and activation states

### File Locations
Based on project structure analysis [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- **Berry Effects Processor**: `ao-processes/game-logic/items/berry-effects-processor.lua` - Core berry activation and effect logic
- **Berry Activation Manager**: `ao-processes/game-logic/items/berry-activation-manager.lua` - Berry trigger monitoring and timing
- **Berry Handler**: `ao-processes/handlers/berry-handler.lua` - AO message processing for berry operations
- **Berry Database**: `ao-processes/data/items/berry-database.lua` - Berry-specific data and activation conditions [already referenced in source-tree.md]
- **Unit Tests**: `ao-processes/tests/unit/items/berry-effects-processor.test.lua`, `ao-processes/tests/unit/items/berry-activation-manager.test.lua`
- **Integration Tests**: `ao-processes/tests/integration/berry-integration.test.lua`

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Tests** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]:
- Location: `ao-processes/tests/unit/items/`
- Framework: Custom Lua test framework with TypeScript comparison utilities
- Coverage Requirement: 100% for berry activation calculations, 95% for berry logic
- Generate tests for all public functions automatically
- Cover edge cases including multiple berry activations, threshold calculations, and timing conflicts
- Mock all external dependencies including Pokemon state management and battle resolution

**Integration Tests** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]:
- Location: `ao-processes/tests/integration/berry-integration.test.lua`
- Test complete berry workflows including assignment, activation, and consumption
- Validate integration with Pokemon state manager for HP monitoring and stat modifications
- Test berry persistence across save/load cycles and battle transitions
- Test berry activation timing and battle turn integration

### Technical Constraints
**Behavioral Parity Requirements** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Never use Lua's math.random() - ALWAYS use AO crypto module for any randomness in berry operations
- All berry activation calculations must match TypeScript implementation exactly
- Never hardcode berry data - always reference berry database tables
- All AO message responses must include success boolean for proper error handling
- Berry activation and effect calculations must be deterministic and reproducible

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Lua 5.3 runtime with AO Handlers for message processing
- In-process Lua tables for berry activation tracking
- JSON message protocol for player/agent communication
- Custom Lua schemas for berry data validation and effect processing
- AO process memory with JSON serialization for berry state persistence

### Project Structure Notes
**Alignment with Existing Structure**: Berry system aligns perfectly with existing item system architecture:
- Leverages existing `ao-processes/game-logic/items/` directory for berry logic
- Integrates with existing `ao-processes/data/items/item-database.lua` for berry data (12 berry types already included)
- Uses existing `ao-processes/game-logic/items/inventory-manager.lua` for berry assignment and consumption
- Builds upon existing held item system from Story 8.2 for berry assignment infrastructure
- Follows established handler pattern in `ao-processes/handlers/` directory

**Berry Database Integration**: Architecture specifies `berry-database.lua` file [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#items], indicating berries have dedicated database separate from general item database for specialized berry mechanics and activation conditions.
