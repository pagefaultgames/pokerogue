# Story 8.2: Held Item System

**Epic:** 8 - Item & Modifier Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-03  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **held item specialist**,
I want **to implement held items that modify Pokémon stats and battle behavior**,
so that **held items provide strategic depth and function identically to current game**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Held item assignment validates one item per Pokémon with swap functionality
2. Stat-boosting items (Life Orb, Choice items) modify stats correctly
3. Type-boosting items increase move power by appropriate percentages
4. Status-related items (Leftovers, Flame Orb) trigger at correct battle timing
5. Battle-restricting items (Choice Band) prevent move selection as intended
6. Consumable held items (berries) activate under proper conditions and disappear
7. Held item interactions with abilities (Unburden, etc.) function correctly
8. Item theft moves (Thief, Switcheroo) transfer held items properly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from previous story (8.1 - Core Item Database & Effects):
- **Item Database Foundation**: Complete item database established with 165+ items across all categories including 10 held items (Choice items, Leftovers, Life Orb, etc.) - held item system can leverage this extensive database
- **Item Effects Infrastructure**: ItemEffectsProcessor system provides comprehensive effect processing with deterministic calculations using AO crypto module - held item system must extend this for stat modifications and battle integration
- **Inventory Integration**: InventoryManager handles item acquisition, removal, and persistence - held item system must integrate for equipping/unequipping validation and persistence
- **Pokemon State Integration**: System successfully integrated with existing Pokemon State Manager for stat calculations - held item effects must extend this integration for stat modifiers
- **Battle System Integration**: Battle Resolution Handler integration established for item usage - held items must integrate for turn-based effect activation and battle restrictions
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive unit and integration test framework established with 100% coverage - held item system must follow identical testing patterns
- **Behavioral Parity**: All calculations must match TypeScript reference implementation exactly using deterministic processing with AO crypto module for RNG
- **Coding Standards Compliance**: Enforced AO crypto module usage (never math.random()) and proper error handling patterns - held item system must maintain identical compliance
