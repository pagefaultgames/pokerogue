# Story 5.4: Complex Environmental Interactions

**Epic:** 5 - Status Effects & Environmental Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As an **advanced mechanics engineer**,
I want **to handle complex interactions between weather, terrain, status effects, and abilities**,
so that **battlefield conditions create strategic depth with proper interaction precedence**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Weather and terrain effect stacking follows proper priority rules
2. Ability-weather interactions (Cloud Nine, Air Lock) suppress weather correctly
3. Move-environment interactions (Hurricane in rain, Solar Beam in sun) work properly
4. Status-environment healing (Rain Dish, Ice Body) activates at correct times
5. Environmental damage (sandstorm, hail) calculated after other end-of-turn effects
6. Field effect removal moves (Defog) clear appropriate conditions
7. Environmental effect notifications display at correct timing
8. Multiple environmental effects resolve in proper game-accurate sequence

## Dev Notes

- **Complete Status Effects System** with all 5 major status conditions (sleep, poison, paralysis, burn, freeze), proper damage calculations (poison: 1/8 HP, burn: 1/16 HP), status interactions and mutual exclusivity rules, comprehensive healing system through moves/items/abilities, type and ability-based immunity validation, full integration with battle handler message processing, and deterministic RNG using AO crypto module [Source: ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/status-effects.lua - VERIFIED EXISTS]
- **Complete Weather System** with all weather conditions (sun, rain, sandstorm, hail) including move power modifications (Â±50% for fire/water in weather), weather damage (1/16 HP for sandstorm/hail), weather-ability interactions (Solar Power, Rain Dish, Cloud Nine, Air Lock), weather-dependent moves (Thunder, Solar Beam, Hurricane), weather duration tracking with 5-turn default, and complex weather-field effect interactions [Source: ao-processes/game-logic/battle/weather-effects.lua + weather-abilities.lua - VERIFIED EXISTS]
- **Complete Terrain Effects System** with all terrain types (Electric, Grassy, Misty, Psychic) including move power modifications (+30%), terrain healing (Grassy: 1/16 HP), status prevention (Misty), priority move blocking (Psychic), grounded Pokemon detection with type/ability checking, terrain-ability interactions (Surge Surfer, Electric Surge, etc.), and full integration with existing weather and status systems [Source: ao-processes/game-logic/battle/terrain-effects.lua + terrain-abilities.lua - VERIFIED EXISTS]

**EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE VERIFIED:**
- Battle Handler integration complete: `ao-processes/handlers/battle-handler.lua` includes all environmental system imports
