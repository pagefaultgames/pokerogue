# Story 6.4: Positional Battle Mechanics

**Epic:** 6 - Arena Tag & Field Effects System  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-09-02  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **positional mechanics engineer**,
I want **to implement position-dependent effects and targeting systems**,
so that **double battle positioning and area-of-effect moves function correctly**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Double battle position tracking maintains left/right battlefield positions
2. Move targeting system distinguishes between single-target and multi-target moves
3. Position-dependent moves (like some doubles-specific moves) target correct positions
4. Ally targeting moves can only target teammate in doubles battles
5. Spread moves affect multiple targets with appropriate damage reduction
6. Position swapping moves (Ally Switch) exchange battlefield positions correctly
7. Positional abilities (Plus/Minus) activate based on adjacent ally abilities
8. Positional tag effects track duration and application correctly per position
