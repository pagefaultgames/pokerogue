# Story 6.1: Entry Hazard System

**Epic:** 6 - Arena Tag & Field Effects System  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **battlefield hazard specialist**,
I want **to implement entry hazards that damage or affect Pokémon when they enter battle**,
so that **strategic field control mechanics like Stealth Rock and Spikes function identically to current game**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Stealth Rock deals damage based on Rock-type effectiveness when Pokémon switches in
2. Spikes deals 1/8, 1/6, or 1/4 max HP damage based on layer count (1-3 layers)
3. Toxic Spikes inflicts poison or badly poisoned status on grounded switch-ins
4. Entry hazard stacking allows multiple layers where applicable
5. Entry hazard removal through moves (Rapid Spin, Defog) clears appropriate hazards
6. Flying-type and Levitate ability Pokémon avoid ground-based hazards
7. Hazard immunity abilities (Magic Guard) prevent hazard damage
8. Side-specific hazard placement affects only the targeted team
