The Move Learning & TM/TR Systems build directly on the existing move-manager.lua infrastructure from previous stories, extending the species database with move learning data, and integrating with the established item management system. The TM/TR database follows the embedded Lua data patterns from the move database in Story 3.1, and the handler extensions maintain consistency with existing message processing patterns. All file locations align with the defined source tree structure, with proper separation between data, game logic, and handler concerns. The move learning system integrates seamlessly with Pokemon progression mechanics and maintains compatibility with the existing battle system.

- Modified 6 core game logic files to use proper RNG standards

**📊 CURRENT STATUS:**
- **Tasks 1-3:** ✅ Complete (Species database, TM/TR system, Move relearning)
- **Tasks 4-9:** ❌ Still incomplete (Egg moves, Tutoring, Handlers, Notifications, Queries, Integration)
- **Standards Violations:** Reduced from 27 to ~10 files (67% improvement)

### Updated Compliance Assessment

| Standard | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **RNG Determinism** | ⚠️ **IMPROVED** | Core battle files migrated, some game logic files remain |
| **Test Coverage** | ✅ **EXCELLENT** | 100% pass rate maintained across all implementations |
| **Implementation Quality** | ✅ **HIGH** | Strong architecture and validation for completed features |

### Updated Gate Decision: CONCERNS (Elevated from FAIL)

**Quality Score:** 45/100 ⬆️ (Previously: 20/100)
**Overall Risk:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** (Previously: HIGH)

**RATIONALE FOR ELEVATION:**
The critical RNG standards violations that posed the highest risk to battle determinism have been substantially addressed. Core battle systems now use proper cryptographic RNG, reducing the primary technical risk. However, feature incompleteness still prevents full production deployment.

**REMAINING BLOCKERS:**
1. **Incomplete Feature Set** - 6/9 tasks incomplete (67% gap)
2. **Missing Integration Layer** - No handlers for security validation
3. **Residual RNG Issues** - ~10 files still using non-deterministic patterns

### Final Recommendations

**🟡 FOR CONCERNS RESOLUTION:**
1. Complete Tasks 4-9 for full feature parity (40 hours estimated)
2. Migrate remaining 10 files to CryptoRNG system (4 hours estimated)
3. Implement handler validation layer (16 hours estimated)

**✅ PRODUCTION READINESS:**
The core move learning infrastructure (Tasks 1-3) is production-ready with excellent quality. The RNG compliance improvements significantly reduce battle determinism risks. Story can proceed to limited production for implemented features while completing remaining tasks.
