# Story 6.2: Field Condition Effects

**Epic:** 6 - Arena Tag & Field Effects System  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **field mechanics developer**,
I want **to implement field-wide conditions that alter battle mechanics globally**,
so that **moves like Trick Room and Wonder Room create strategic battlefield modifications**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Trick Room reverses speed priority so slower Pokémon move first
2. Wonder Room swaps Defense and Special Defense stats for all active Pokémon
3. Magic Room prevents held items from having any effect during battle
4. Field condition duration tracking with 5-turn default length
5. Field condition interactions with abilities and moves handled properly
6. Multiple field conditions can coexist when effects don't conflict
7. Field condition removal moves end appropriate effects immediately
8. Field condition notifications display at battle start and end

## Project Structure Notes
File locations align perfectly with existing project structure from `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`. The field condition system will be implemented building on the existing battle conditions system (`ao-processes/game-logic/battle/battle-conditions.lua`) and priority calculator system (`ao-processes/game-logic/battle/priority-calculator.lua`) which already contains Trick Room infrastructure. The implementation extends the established architecture patterns while integrating seamlessly with existing battle handler from Story 4.1, damage calculator from Story 4.2, battle state management from Story 4.3, victory/defeat system from Story 4.4, status effects system from Story 5.1, weather system from Story 5.2, terrain system from Story 5.3, environmental interactions from Story 5.4, and entry hazards system from Story 6.1. The system leverages existing environmental precedence system and integrates with the comprehensive field effect management already established.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Field Condition Effects system implementation demonstrates solid architecture with comprehensive integration across battle systems. The core field-conditions.lua module provides a complete foundation for Trick Room, Wonder Room, and Magic Room mechanics with proper duration tracking, coexistence rules, and environmental system integration. However, critical integration functions were missing from move-effects.lua, causing runtime failures when field condition moves are executed.

Key strengths include robust field condition data structures, comprehensive stat modification logic for Wonder Room, proper priority reversal handling for Trick Room, and complete item suppression mechanics for Magic Room. The integration with existing environmental systems (weather, terrain, entry hazards) follows established patterns and maintains consistency.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/move-effects.lua`
  - **Change**: Added missing field condition integration functions: `shouldFieldConditionMoveFail`, `processFieldConditionMove`, `processTrickRoomEffect`, `processWonderRoomEffect`, `processMagicRoomEffect`
  - **Why**: These functions were called by existing executeMove logic but not implemented, causing runtime errors during field condition move execution
  - **How**: Implemented complete field condition move processing pipeline with proper battle state integration, duration setting, and compatibility field updates for existing systems

- **File**: `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/field-conditions.lua`
  - **Change**: Fixed variable shadowing in `processWonderRoomStats` and `processMagicRoomItems` functions
  - **Why**: Variable names `modifiedPokemon` were used for both the array and individual Pokemon objects, causing logic errors and potential crashes
  - **How**: Renamed collection variables to `modifiedPokemonList` to eliminate shadowing and ensure correct data flow

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Functions follow camelCase convention, proper error handling with success booleans, uses AO crypto module for RNG (battle-rng.lua), never hardcodes data (references FieldEffectData)
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed correctly in game-logic/battle/ hierarchy, follows established module pattern, integrates with existing battle handler workflow
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests provided covering all field condition mechanics, 100% coverage approach for critical logic, proper AAA test patterns
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria implemented: Trick Room priority reversal, Wonder Room stat swapping, Magic Room item suppression, duration tracking, ability interactions, coexistence rules, removal system, battle notifications

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items I handled during review, remaining for dev to address]

- [x] Added missing field condition move processing functions (move-effects.lua)
- [x] Fixed variable shadowing issues in field condition processors (field-conditions.lua)
- [x] Verified integration with priority calculator for Trick Room effects
- [x] Confirmed stat calculator integration for Wonder Room stat modifications
- [x] Validated Magic Room item suppression logic
- [ ] Consider extracting field condition constants to shared enum module
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging for field condition failures
- [ ] Implement field condition usage analytics for battle replay system

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Field conditions operate within the deterministic battle system using seeded RNG, maintain proper validation of battle state parameters, and do not expose sensitive game data. All field condition effects are temporary and reversible, preventing permanent game state corruption.

### Performance Considerations

Field condition processing adds minimal overhead to battle turns. Stat modification operations are O(1) for individual Pokemon, priority calculations remain O(n log n) for action ordering. Memory usage is bounded by active Pokemon count. Field condition state is efficiently stored in battle state with minimal serialization impact.

### Files Modified During Review

- `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/move-effects.lua` - Added missing field condition integration functions
- `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/field-conditions.lua` - Fixed variable shadowing issues

Ask Dev to update File List to include these modifications.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/6.2-field-condition-effects.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/6.2-risk-20250902.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/6.2-nfr-20250902.md

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All critical integration issues resolved, comprehensive field condition system fully functional with proper battle system integration.
