# Story 5.1: Pokémon Status Conditions

**Epic:** 5 - Status Effects & Environmental Systems  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-29  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **status effect specialist**,
I want **to implement all status conditions (sleep, poison, paralysis, burn, freeze) with proper mechanics**,
so that **status effects function identically to current game with correct damage, duration, and interaction rules**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sleep status prevents move usage with proper wake-up chance calculations
2. Poison status deals 1/8 max HP damage each turn with badly poisoned escalation
3. Paralysis status causes 25% move failure and 50% speed reduction
4. Burn status deals 1/16 max HP damage and reduces physical attack by 50%
5. Freeze status prevents moves with 20% thaw chance (higher with fire moves)
6. Status condition interactions (can't sleep while poisoned, etc.) enforced
7. Status condition curing through moves, abilities, and items works correctly
8. Status condition immunities based on type and ability function properly

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Epic 4 completion (Stories 4.1-4.4):
- **Complete Turn-Based Battle Engine** with speed-based action ordering, priority move handling, comprehensive AO message handler system with session management, battle state persistence, and deterministic battle processing using AO crypto module [Source: docs/stories/4.1.story.md, docs/stories/4.4.story.md]
- **Complete Damage Calculation System** with exact TypeScript formula parity, full type effectiveness integration (0x through 8x multipliers), STAB calculation, deterministic critical hit system, stat stage modifications, weather effects, and extensible design for ability/item effects [Source: docs/stories/4.2.story.md]
- **Complete Battle State & Switching System** with active Pokémon tracking, battle state transitions, Pokémon status persistence (including `statusEffect` field), switch validation, forced switches, switch-in effects, battle participation tracking, and battle memory systems [Source: docs/stories/4.3.story.md]
- **Complete Battle Victory & Defeat System** with victory/defeat detection, experience point distribution, reward calculations, battle statistics tracking, and battle cleanup while preserving persistent state [Source: docs/stories/4.4.story.md]

This provides the complete foundation for implementing status conditions with full integration into existing battle turn processing, damage calculations, battle state management, and persistent status tracking across switches and battle conclusions.
