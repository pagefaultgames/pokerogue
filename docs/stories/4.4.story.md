**Epic:** 4 - Core Battle System & Turn Resolution  
**Status:** Done
**Created:** 2025-08-28  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **battle conclusion specialist**,
I want **to properly detect and handle battle end conditions with appropriate rewards**,
so that **battles conclude correctly with proper experience, money, and item rewards**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Victory conditions detected when opponent has no usable Pokémon remaining
2. Defeat conditions handled when player has no usable Pokémon remaining
3. Experience point distribution calculated correctly for participating Pokémon
4. Money rewards calculated based on trainer type and Pokémon levels
5. Item drops and rewards distributed according to battle outcome
6. Battle statistics updated for participating Pokémon and player records
7. Forfeit/escape attempts processed with appropriate success rates
8. Battle cleanup resets temporary battle state and restores persistent state

### API Specifications
No specific API specifications found in architecture docs - battle victory and defeat system will integrate with existing battle handler message processing system established in Stories 4.1-4.3.

### Component Specifications
**Battle Resolution Handler:** [Source: architecture/components.md#battle-resolution-handler, architecture/source-tree.md#battle-mechanics]

- Heavy integration testing for battle completion workflows including experience distribution and reward calculations

### Technical Constraints
**Deterministic Battle Conclusions:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- All victory/defeat condition checks must be deterministic and reproducible using battle seeds
- Experience point calculations must match TypeScript implementation exactly for identical reward outcomes
- Reward distribution must be deterministic for consistent battle completion results across sessions
- All AO message responses must include success boolean for battle conclusion command error handling

**State Persistence:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Battle completion state must be serializable for session persistence and replay capability
- Pokemon experience gains must persist correctly across battle conclusions and session transitions
- Player progression updates must maintain consistency during battle completion and state cleanup

**Data Integrity:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mandatory-behavioral-parity-rules]
- Never hardcode Pokemon party data - always reference player party tables for victory/defeat validation
- Experience calculations must reference actual battle participation data for accurate reward distribution
- Maintain single source of truth for player progression data and battle statistics tracking
