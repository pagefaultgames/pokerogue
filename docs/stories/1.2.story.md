# Story 1.2: Game Logic Authorization & Anti-Cheating

**Epic:** 1 - AO Process Foundation & Security  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Assigned:** Developer Agent  

## Story Statement
As a **game security engineer**,
I want **to implement game-specific authorization patterns and cheat prevention**,
so that **players can only perform valid game actions and cannot manipulate battle outcomes or progression**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Player ownership validation ensures players can only modify their own game state
2. Game action validation prevents invalid moves, impossible stats, or illegal items
3. Battle result verification ensures damage calculations and outcomes follow game rules
4. Progress validation prevents skipping content or gaining impossible experience/items
5. State consistency checks detect and prevent corrupted or manipulated game data
6. Resource validation ensures players cannot exceed item limits or currency caps
7. Timing validation prevents impossible action sequences or accelerated progression
8. Deterministic RNG validation ensures battle outcomes match expected probability distributions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion, we have established:
- **AO Process Architecture Established** with comprehensive handler framework using native AO Handlers pattern
- **Handler Registration Framework** with discovery capabilities and message routing system
- **Process Administration** with AO protocol compliance and agent integration support
- **Error Handling Framework** with structured error types, correlation IDs, and comprehensive logging
- **Authentication framework established** with proper sender validation pattern using wallet addresses

This provides the foundation for implementing authorization and anti-cheating mechanisms.

### Data Models
**Player Data Validation:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#player-model]
- Player identification via wallet address for ownership validation
- Game progression state tracking for content validation
- Pokemon party and PC storage for collection limits
- Inventory tracking for resource caps and item validation
- Game statistics for progression validation

**Pokemon Data Integrity:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#pokemon-model]  
- Species, level, and stat validation against game rules
- Experience points and progression consistency checks
- Moveset validation against learn sets and legal moves
- Status effects and battle state validation
- Individual values (IVs) and nature validation for stat calculation integrity

**Battle State Validation:** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#battle-model]
- Battle seed tracking for deterministic RNG validation
- Turn order and command validation
- Battle state consistency across turn processing
- Player party composition validation

### API Specifications
**Authorization Pattern:** [Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]
- AO message sender validation using wallet addresses
- Stateless authentication per message
- Player ownership validation: "Only message sender can modify their own game data"
- Battle participation validation through active battle roster

**Input Validation Requirements:** [Source: architecture/security.md#input-validation]
- Custom Lua validation system (no external dependencies)
- All validation performed at handler entry points before processing
- Validation at AO message boundary before any game logic processing
- Whitelist approach preferred over blacklist for allowed values

**Game State Integrity:** [Source: architecture/security.md#game-state-integrity]
- Atomic message processing prevents partial state corruption
- Anti-cheating through input validation prevents impossible game states

### Component Specifications
**Security Handler Components:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Authorization Handler:** `ao-processes/handlers/auth-handler.lua` - Player ownership and permission validation
- **Validation Handler:** `ao-processes/handlers/validation-handler.lua` - Game action and state validation
- **Anti-Cheat Handler:** `ao-processes/handlers/anti-cheat-handler.lua` - Cheat detection and prevention

**Game Logic Validation:** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Pokemon Validation:** `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/pokemon-validator.lua` - Pokemon stat and state validation
- **Battle Validation:** `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/battle-validator.lua` - Battle action and outcome validation
- **RNG Validation:** `ao-processes/game-logic/rng/rng-validator.lua` - Deterministic RNG verification

### File Locations
Based on project structure from source-tree.md:
- Authorization logic: `ao-processes/handlers/auth-handler.lua`
- Game validation: `ao-processes/handlers/validation-handler.lua`
- Anti-cheat systems: `ao-processes/handlers/anti-cheat-handler.lua`
- Pokemon validation: `ao-processes/game-logic/pokemon/pokemon-validator.lua`
- Battle validation: `ao-processes/game-logic/battle/battle-validator.lua`
- RNG validation: `ao-processes/game-logic/rng/rng-validator.lua`

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#unit-tests]
- Custom Lua test framework with TypeScript comparison utilities
- File convention: `*.test.lua` files co-located with implementation modules
- Location: `ao-processes/tests/unit/`
- 100% coverage for security validation functions
- Edge cases and error conditions systematically tested

**Integration Testing:** [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- Complete handler workflows including message processing and security validation
- Location: `ao-processes/tests/integration/`
- Battle state management for security testing scenarios
- Message simulation with mock AO message objects
- State validation and consistency checking

**Security Testing Requirements:**
- Cheat attempt simulation and detection testing
- Invalid input boundary testing
- Authorization bypass attempt testing
- State corruption detection testing

### Technical Constraints
**Error Handling Requirements:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#general-approach]
- Exception-based error handling using Lua's `error()` and `pcall()` patterns
- Structured error types with specific error codes for security violations
- Errors bubble up to handler level converted to informative AO message responses
- Correlation ID system for security event tracking

**Business Logic Errors:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#business-logic-errors]
- Custom exceptions for game rule violations
- Clear error messages for invalid player actions
- Structured error code system for consistent security error handling

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- Functions: camelCase (`validatePlayerOwnership()`)
- Variables: camelCase (`authResult`, `validationError`)  
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_POKEMON_LEVEL`, `INVALID_OWNERSHIP`)
- Tables/Objects: PascalCase (`AuthHandler`, `ValidationResult`)
- Files: kebab-case (`auth-handler.lua`, `pokemon-validator.lua`)

**Mandatory Behavioral Rules:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All AO message responses must include success boolean for proper error handling
- Never hardcode validation thresholds - always reference game constants
- All validation must use exact mathematical comparisons matching TypeScript behavior

### Security Requirements
**Authentication & Authorization:** [Source: architecture/security.md#authentication-authorization]
- AO message sender validation using wallet addresses for all operations
- Stateless authentication - each message independently authenticated
- Player ownership validation - only message sender can modify their own game data
- Battle participation validation through active battle roster membership

**Anti-Cheating Measures:** [Source: architecture/security.md#game-state-integrity]
- Input validation prevents impossible game states
- Atomic message processing prevents partial state corruption
- State consistency validation across all game operations
- Resource limits enforcement to prevent exploitation
