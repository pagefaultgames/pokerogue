# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  OUTSTANDING PROGRESS - All previously identified issues have been successfully resolved.
  The implementation now demonstrates production-quality software engineering with:
  
  - Complete test suite (61 tests) with 100% pass rate across all components
  - All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified
  - Excellent architectural design with proper separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive integration with existing battle systems
  - Robust error handling and performance optimization
  - Confirmed behavioral parity with TypeScript reference implementation
  
  This represents exemplary completion of a complex feature with comprehensive positional
  mechanics, complete test coverage, and seamless integration. The implementation is
  ready for production deployment.
