# PokéRogue Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• **Complete AO-Native Game Engine Migration** - Achieve 100% functional parity with current PokéRogue on AO processes with zero game mechanics lost
• **Establish Permanent Save System** - Eliminate save corruption and enable cross-device gameplay through AO process persistence  
• **Enable Autonomous Agent Integration** - Create first UI-agnostic roguelike where AI agents can participate as first-class players
• **Demonstrate AO Gaming Feasibility** - Prove complex game logic can operate effectively on AO protocol at scale
• **Build Decentralized Gaming Foundation** - Remove centralized server dependencies while maintaining player experience
• **Create Open Source Reference** - Establish reproducible workflow for AO game development that other projects can adopt

### Background Context

This PRD addresses the fundamental limitation that PokéRogue, as a browser-dependent centralized game, excludes the growing ecosystem of autonomous AI agents from participation. The current architecture creates fragile save systems (15-20% of players lose progress), requires centralized servers, and prevents the emerging market of 500+ AO agent developers from building gaming integrations.

The migration strategy leverages AO's turn-based message-passing architecture to solve these problems through a three-phase approach: first migrating game mechanics to AO handlers for permanent storage and reliability, then integrating the existing UI through AOConnect, and finally enabling AI agents to participate alongside human players in a truly decentralized PVPVE environment.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The user experience transitions from traditional browser-based gaming to a hybrid model where human players use familiar interfaces while autonomous agents interact directly with game logic. Phase 1 focuses on headless AO functionality, Phase 2 reintegrates the existing Phaser UI through AOConnect, and Phase 3 enables seamless human-agent mixed gameplay where both interaction methods feel natural and equivalent.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Message-Driven Architecture:** All game actions (battle commands, item usage, movement) translate to AO messages, enabling both UI clicks and agent API calls to trigger identical game responses
- **Asynchronous Turn-Based Flow:** Leverages AO's message-passing for turn-based mechanics that work naturally across time zones and don't require real-time coordination
- **Cross-Device Continuity:** Game state accessible from any device with AO connectivity, eliminating browser-specific save dependencies
- **Transparent Backend Integration:** Players experience identical gameplay to current version while benefiting from AO's permanent storage and reliability

### Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:
- **Battle Interface** - Core turn-based combat with creature, move, and status display
- **Creature Management Screen** - PC storage, party management, creature stats/movesets
- **Inventory and Shop Interface** - Item management, purchases, consumable usage
- **World Map/Progress Screen** - Biome navigation, gym/elite four progress tracking
- **Game State Dashboard** - Save/load functionality, cross-device sync status
- **Settings and Configuration** - AOConnect setup, account management for AO integration

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Maintain current accessibility standards while adding AO-specific considerations:
- Screen reader compatibility for AO connection status and game state information
- Keyboard navigation for all AOConnect-bridged functionality
- High contrast modes that work with AO message loading states
- Alternative input methods for players who prefer direct AO message interaction over UI

### Branding
Preserve PokéRogue's existing visual identity and game feel:
- Maintain current pixel art aesthetic and creature designs
- Preserve existing color palette and UI styling from Phaser implementation  
- Simple wallet connect/disconnect button for AO connectivity without disrupting game immersion
- Agent interactions visible to human players for spectating and mixed gameplay awareness
- Ensure autonomous agent battles feel integrated as part of the game world

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Primary:** Desktop browsers with AOConnect support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **Secondary:** Mobile browsers for monitoring game state and simple interactions
- **Agent Interface:** Headless AO message API for autonomous agent participation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Identical game logic and state across all access methods

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository approach with organized directories maintaining clean separation:
- `/typescript/` - Existing PokéRogue TypeScript/Phaser codebase
- `/lua/` - AO process Lua handler implementations
- `/bridge/` - AOConnect integration layer for Phase 2
- `/tests/` - Parity testing between TypeScript and Lua implementations
- No shared code folders - each implementation remains completely independent
- Unified repository enables coordinated development while maintaining codebase isolation

### Service Architecture
**Phase 1: Single Comprehensive AO Process**
- All game logic consolidated into one AO process for MVP simplicity
- Handler specialization within single process (battle, state, queries)
- Internal message routing for different game operations
- Architecture designed for potential multi-process expansion in later phases

**Rationale:** Single process reduces deployment complexity and ensures atomic game state management while proving AO feasibility for complex games.

### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
**Critical Requirement:** Comprehensive testing to ensure zero functionality loss during migration
- **Parity Testing:** Automated comparison of TypeScript vs Lua battle outcomes
- **Integration Testing:** AOConnect bridge functionality and message handling
- **Load Testing:** AO process performance under concurrent game load
- **End-to-End Testing:** Complete game runs from start to champion victory
- **Agent Integration Testing:** Autonomous agent message protocol validation

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Core Language and Framework:**
- **Backend:** Lua 5.3 for AO process handler implementation using AO's native `Handlers.add()` pattern
- **Frontend Bridge:** Continue using existing Phaser.js with TypeScript, integrated via `@permaweb/aoconnect`
- **Message Protocol:** AO's native message-passing system for all game interactions

**Development Environment:**
- **Local AO Emulation:** Required for development and testing workflow
- **Handler Debugging:** AO process logging and message trace analysis capabilities
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Support for contributors on different operating systems

**Data Management:**
- **State Persistence:** Automatic through AO process storage on Arweave (no additional database required)
- **Message Serialization:** JSON format for complex game objects and state transfers
- **Deterministic RNG:** Reproducible random number generation for consistent gameplay across process instances

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Handler Optimization:** Lua code optimized for AO runtime constraints
- **Message Efficiency:** Minimize message size and frequency for optimal network performance
- **State Query Optimization:** Efficient game state retrieval for UI synchronization

**AO Protocol Compliance:**
- **Documentation Protocol:** Mandatory `Info` handler and discoverable handler specifications
- **Handler Discoverability:** All game operations must be queryable through AO documentation protocol
- **Process Metadata:** Version tracking and capability information for agent integration
