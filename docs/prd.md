# PokéRogue ECS HyperBeam Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform PokéRogue into a high-performance, cache-optimized game engine using Entity-Component-System architecture
- Achieve 10x performance improvements through SIMD vectorization and data-oriented design patterns
- Create the world's first decentralized roguelike optimized for autonomous agent participation on Arweave AO
- Establish a greenfield foundation that eliminates all legacy architectural technical debt
- Enable massive scalability through cache-efficient component processing and parallel system execution
- Demonstrate cutting-edge ECS patterns that can serve as reference architecture for future games

### Background Context

PokéRogue represents a revolutionary leap from traditional object-oriented game architecture to a pure Entity-Component-System implementation optimized for the Arweave AO protocol. This greenfield approach eliminates the constraints of legacy migration, enabling the implementation of cutting-edge performance optimizations including SIMD vectorization, cache-friendly memory layouts, and data-oriented design patterns.

The ECS HyperBeam architecture addresses fundamental performance bottlenecks in traditional game engines by treating data and behavior as separate concerns, allowing for unprecedented optimization opportunities. This approach enables the game to process thousands of entities simultaneously while maintaining real-time responsiveness, positioning PokéRogue as the first truly performance-optimized decentralized game.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository approach for coordinated HyperBeam migration:
- `/devices/` - Rust WASM device implementations (battle, stats, evolution, etc.)
- `/shared/` - Shared Rust types and traits across devices  
- `/hyperbeam-process/` - HyperBeam process configuration and state management
- `/arweave-data/` - Pokemon species, moves, and items data for external storage
- `/typescript-reference/` - Current implementation for parity testing

### Service Architecture
**Single HyperBeam Process + Distributed WASM Devices**
- HyperBeam process maintains ECS world state (entities, components, player sessions)
- Rust WASM devices handle game logic (battle resolution, stat calculation, evolution)  
- External Arweave storage provides Pokemon species, moves, and items data
- Device routing and message orchestration managed by HyperBeam
- 95% bundle size reduction through external data references

**Rationale:** HyperBeam-native architecture eliminates multi-process complexity while enabling modular Rust device development for type-safe game logic.

### Testing Requirements: Migration Parity Validation

- **Rust WASM Devices:** Stateless, type-safe computational units for game logic (~pokemon-stats@1.0, ~battle-engine@1.0, etc.)
- **External Data Storage:** Arweave transactions for Pokemon species, moves, and items databases (2MB+ data moved external)
- **Device Communication:** HyperBeam message routing to appropriate devices based on action type

**Migration Approach:**
- **TypeScript Reference:** Preserve existing implementation for parity validation
- **Rust Device Logic:** Migrate battle calculations, stat computations, evolution logic to type-safe Rust
- **External Data Migration:** Move static game data to Arweave for bundle size optimization
- **State Synchronization:** ECS entity state managed by HyperBeam with device-computed updates

**Performance Requirements:**
