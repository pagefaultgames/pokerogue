# Epic 28: Testing & Quality Assurance Systems

## Epic Goal
Implement comprehensive testing framework ensuring zero functionality loss during TypeScript-to-Lua migration, with automated parity testing, integration testing, and quality validation.

## Story 28.1: Parity Testing Framework
As a **parity testing architect**,
I want **to implement automated testing that verifies identical behavior between TypeScript and Lua implementations**,
so that **migration maintains perfect functional parity with zero gameplay regressions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Battle outcome parity testing compares TypeScript vs Lua battle results for identical scenarios
2. Damage calculation verification ensures exact matching of all damage formulas
3. RNG parity testing validates identical random number generation across implementations
4. Status effect verification confirms matching behavior for all status conditions
5. Move effect parity ensures identical outcomes for all move mechanics
6. Evolution trigger testing validates identical evolution conditions and timing
7. Item effect verification confirms matching behavior for all item interactions
8. Statistical parity analysis validates large-scale behavior matching across many test cases

## Story 28.2: Integration Testing Suite
As a **integration testing specialist**,
I want **to implement comprehensive integration testing for all system interactions**,
so that **complex multi-system interactions work correctly across the entire migration**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. End-to-end gameplay testing validates complete game runs from start to finish
2. Cross-system interaction testing verifies proper communication between different epics
3. AOConnect integration testing ensures reliable UI-to-AO communication
4. Agent integration testing validates autonomous agent participation flows
5. Data persistence testing confirms reliable state management across sessions
6. Performance integration testing verifies acceptable response times under load
7. Error handling integration testing validates graceful failure modes
8. Security integration testing ensures proper authorization across all systems

## Story 28.3: Automated Test Infrastructure
As a **test infrastructure engineer**,
I want **to create automated testing infrastructure that runs continuously**,
so that **any regressions are detected immediately during development**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Continuous integration pipeline runs all tests automatically on code changes
2. Test result reporting provides clear feedback on test failures and regressions
3. Performance regression detection alerts when systems become slower than benchmarks
4. Test data management maintains consistent test scenarios across test runs
5. Test environment provisioning creates isolated environments for reliable testing
6. Parallel test execution enables fast feedback cycles during development
7. Test coverage analysis ensures comprehensive testing of all critical systems
8. Historical test result tracking identifies trends and recurring issues

## Story 28.4: Quality Validation & Release Gates
As a **quality assurance coordinator**,
I want **to implement quality gates that prevent releases with insufficient testing**,
so that **only fully validated systems reach production deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Release criteria validation ensures all quality standards are met before deployment
2. Critical path testing validates essential gameplay functions work correctly
3. Performance benchmarking confirms acceptable system performance under load
4. Security validation ensures proper protection of player data and system integrity
5. Compatibility testing validates functionality across different browsers and devices
6. Stress testing confirms system stability under high concurrent usage
7. Rollback testing ensures ability to revert changes if issues are discovered
8. Sign-off procedures require explicit approval from quality assurance before release
