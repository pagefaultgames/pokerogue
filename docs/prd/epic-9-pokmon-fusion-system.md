# Epic 9: Pokémon Fusion System

## Epic Goal
Implement Pokemon fusion mechanics including fusion creation, hybrid stats calculation, fusion sprites, fusion evolution, and fusion-specific battle interactions, enabling PokéRogue's signature fusion gameplay.

## Story 9.1: Fusion Creation & Validation
As a **fusion system architect**,
I want **to implement the core fusion mechanics that combine two Pokémon into a hybrid**,
so that **players can create fusion Pokémon with combined stats, types, and abilities identically to current game**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Fusion process validates compatibility between base and fusion Pokémon species
2. Fusion creation combines base stats using proper weighted averaging formulas
3. Type combination follows fusion rules (primary from base, secondary from fusion partner)
4. Ability selection chooses from both parents' ability pools according to fusion rules
5. Fusion Pokémon maintains unique fusion ID for identification and tracking
6. Fusion validation prevents invalid combinations and enforces fusion restrictions
7. Fusion process preserves level, experience, and individual values appropriately
8. Fusion cost calculation (if applicable) validates required resources

## Story 9.2: Fusion Battle Mechanics
As a **fusion battle specialist**,
I want **to implement fusion-specific battle behaviors and interactions**,
so that **fusion Pokémon battle identically to current game with proper move access and type interactions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Fusion movesets combine moves from both parent species according to fusion rules
2. Fusion type effectiveness calculations account for dual typing properly
3. Fusion abilities function correctly with proper activation conditions
4. Fusion-specific moves and interactions work identically to current implementation
5. Fusion status effect interactions handle dual-type considerations properly
6. Fusion switching mechanics validate fusion state during battle transitions
7. Fusion damage calculations use combined stats with proper formulas
8. Fusion critical hit and accuracy calculations use fusion-specific values

## Story 9.3: Fusion Evolution & Form Changes
As a **fusion evolution developer**,
I want **to implement evolution mechanics for fusion Pokémon with proper condition checking**,
so that **fusion Pokémon can evolve maintaining fusion properties with correct triggers**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Fusion evolution validates evolution conditions for both component species
2. Fusion evolution maintains fusion properties while evolving component parts
3. Fusion evolution stone compatibility checks both parent species requirements
4. Fusion evolution level requirements consider both species' evolution levels
5. Fusion evolution preserves fusion stat combinations after evolution
6. Fusion evolution updates movesets according to new evolved forms
7. Fusion evolution handles cases where only one parent can evolve
8. Fusion evolution maintains fusion ID continuity through evolution process

## Story 9.4: Fusion Separation & Management
As a **fusion management specialist**,
I want **to implement fusion separation and fusion Pokémon management systems**,
so that **players can separate fusions and manage fusion Pokémon in their collection**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Fusion separation process restores original component Pokémon properly
2. Fusion separation maintains individual stats and properties of original Pokémon
3. Fusion separation validates that separated Pokémon return to correct party/PC slots
4. Fusion management tracks fusion history and component relationships
5. Fusion collection display shows fusion status and component species information
6. Fusion search and filtering enables finding specific fusion combinations
7. Fusion separation prevents duplication exploits and maintains game balance
8. Fusion storage system handles fusion Pokémon in PC and party management
