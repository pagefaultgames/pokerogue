# Epic 1: AO Process Foundation & Security

## Epic Goal
Establish the foundational AO process infrastructure and security framework that will support all game mechanics, ensuring secure message handling and proper authorization patterns for the entire Pok√©Rogue migration.

## Story 1.1: AO Process Architecture Setup
As a **system architect**,
I want **to establish the core AO process structure and handler framework**,
so that **all game mechanics can be built on a solid, standardized foundation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Single comprehensive AO process deployed and accessible via AO protocol
2. Handler registration system implemented using AO's native `Handlers.add()` pattern
3. Process Info handler implemented for AO documentation protocol compliance
4. Handler discovery system allows querying all available game operations
5. Process metadata includes version tracking and capability information
6. Basic message routing system directs different game operations to appropriate handlers
7. Error handling framework provides consistent error responses across all handlers
8. Process initialization sequence establishes all required handlers and state

## Story 1.2: Game Logic Authorization & Anti-Cheating
As a **game security engineer**,
I want **to implement game-specific authorization patterns and cheat prevention**,
so that **players can only perform valid game actions and cannot manipulate battle outcomes or progression**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Player ownership validation ensures players can only modify their own game state
2. Game action validation prevents invalid moves, impossible stats, or illegal items
3. Battle result verification ensures damage calculations and outcomes follow game rules
4. Progress validation prevents skipping content or gaining impossible experience/items
5. State consistency checks detect and prevent corrupted or manipulated game data
6. Resource validation ensures players cannot exceed item limits or currency caps
7. Timing validation prevents impossible action sequences or accelerated progression
8. Deterministic RNG validation ensures battle outcomes match expected probability distributions

## Story 1.3: Development Environment & Testing Framework
As a **AO game developer**,
I want **to establish local development tools and testing infrastructure**,
so that **I can efficiently develop and validate game handlers before deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Local AO emulation environment for development and testing
2. Handler testing framework validates individual game operations
3. Message simulation tools test complex game scenarios
4. State inspection utilities allow debugging game state issues
5. Performance benchmarking tools measure handler execution times
6. Parity testing framework compares TypeScript vs Lua game logic outcomes
7. Automated test suite validates handler functionality
8. Documentation generator creates handler API specifications

## Story 1.4: Game State Management Foundation
As a **game system designer**,
I want **to establish core game state structure and persistence patterns**,
so that **player data is reliably stored and accessible across all game systems**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Player state schema defines structure for all player-specific data
2. Game session management tracks active player sessions and state
3. State validation ensures game data integrity and consistency
4. Atomic state updates prevent partial or corrupted game state
5. State query system allows efficient retrieval of player data
6. State migration framework supports future schema changes
7. Backup and recovery patterns protect against data loss
8. Cross-handler state sharing enables communication between different game systems
