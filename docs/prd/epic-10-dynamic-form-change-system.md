# Epic 10: Dynamic Form Change System

## Epic Goal
Migrate complex Pokemon transformation system with weather-based, item-triggered, ability-based, move-learned, post-move, and timed form changes, enabling sophisticated Pokémon form mechanics.

## Story 10.1: Conditional Form Change System
As a **form change architect**,
I want **to implement form changes triggered by specific conditions and triggers**,
so that **Pokémon transform based on weather, items, abilities, and other factors identically to current game**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Weather-based form changes activate when appropriate weather conditions are active
2. Item-triggered form changes validate item possession and usage requirements
3. Ability-based form changes activate when specific abilities are present or triggered
4. Time-based form changes consider day/night cycles and time-of-day requirements
5. Location-based form changes validate current biome or area conditions
6. Form change validation ensures only valid transformations are permitted
7. Form change triggers check multiple conditions simultaneously when required
8. Form change activation preserves Pokémon identity and core stats appropriately

## Story 10.2: Move-Based Form Changes
As a **move interaction specialist**,
I want **to implement form changes that occur based on moves learned or used**,
so that **Pokémon transform in response to movesets and move usage as in current game**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Move-learned form changes trigger when specific moves are added to moveset
2. Post-move form changes activate after using specific moves in battle
3. Pre-move form changes occur before move execution when conditions are met
4. Form change move interactions maintain proper timing and execution order
5. Move-based form changes validate move compatibility and usage requirements
6. Form change interruption handles cases where moves fail or are prevented
7. Move-dependent forms revert appropriately when moves are forgotten or unavailable
8. Form change move effects integrate properly with battle flow and timing

## Story 10.3: Temporary vs Permanent Form Changes
As a **form state manager**,
I want **to distinguish between temporary and permanent form transformations**,
so that **form changes persist correctly and revert when appropriate conditions end**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Temporary form changes revert when triggering conditions end (weather ends, etc.)
2. Permanent form changes maintain new form until different conditions trigger change
3. Form change duration tracking counts down properly for time-limited transformations
4. Battle-only form changes revert to base form when battle ends
5. Form change priority resolves conflicts when multiple triggers are active
6. Form reversion validates that Pokémon can safely return to previous form
7. Form change stacking handles cases where multiple form changes could apply
8. Form change persistence maintains form state across battles and game sessions

## Story 10.4: Form-Specific Stats & Abilities
As a **form variant specialist**,
I want **to implement form-specific stat changes, abilities, and type modifications**,
so that **each form provides unique battle characteristics and strategic options**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Form-specific base stats override default species stats when form is active
2. Form-specific abilities replace or modify base abilities according to form rules
3. Form-specific typing changes affect type effectiveness and STAB calculations
4. Form-specific movesets add or restrict available moves based on current form
5. Form-specific sprite and appearance changes reflect current transformation
6. Form stat modifications integrate properly with battle calculations
7. Form ability changes trigger appropriate activation and deactivation effects
8. Form-specific weaknesses and resistances apply correctly in battle situations
