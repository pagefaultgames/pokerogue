# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience transitions from traditional browser-based gaming to a hybrid model where human players use familiar interfaces while autonomous agents interact directly with game logic. Phase 1 focuses on headless AO functionality, Phase 2 reintegrates the existing Phaser UI through AOConnect, and Phase 3 enables seamless human-agent mixed gameplay where both interaction methods feel natural and equivalent.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Message-Driven Architecture:** All game actions (battle commands, item usage, movement) translate to AO messages, enabling both UI clicks and agent API calls to trigger identical game responses
- **Asynchronous Turn-Based Flow:** Leverages AO's message-passing for turn-based mechanics that work naturally across time zones and don't require real-time coordination
- **Cross-Device Continuity:** Game state accessible from any device with AO connectivity, eliminating browser-specific save dependencies
- **Transparent Backend Integration:** Players experience identical gameplay to current version while benefiting from AO's permanent storage and reliability

## Core Screens and Views
From a product perspective, the critical screens necessary to deliver PRD value:
- **Battle Interface** - Core turn-based combat with creature, move, and status display
- **Creature Management Screen** - PC storage, party management, creature stats/movesets
- **Inventory and Shop Interface** - Item management, purchases, consumable usage
- **World Map/Progress Screen** - Biome navigation, gym/elite four progress tracking
- **Game State Dashboard** - Save/load functionality, cross-device sync status
- **Settings and Configuration** - AOConnect setup, account management for AO integration

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Maintain current accessibility standards while adding AO-specific considerations:
- Screen reader compatibility for AO connection status and game state information
- Keyboard navigation for all AOConnect-bridged functionality
- High contrast modes that work with AO message loading states
- Alternative input methods for players who prefer direct AO message interaction over UI

## Branding
Preserve Pok√©Rogue's existing visual identity and game feel:
- Maintain current pixel art aesthetic and creature designs
- Preserve existing color palette and UI styling from Phaser implementation  
- Simple wallet connect/disconnect button for AO connectivity without disrupting game immersion
- Agent interactions visible to human players for spectating and mixed gameplay awareness
- Ensure autonomous agent battles feel integrated as part of the game world

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
- **Primary:** Desktop browsers with AOConnect support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
- **Secondary:** Mobile browsers for monitoring game state and simple interactions
- **Agent Interface:** Headless AO message API for autonomous agent participation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Identical game logic and state across all access methods
