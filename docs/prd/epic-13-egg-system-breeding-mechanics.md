# Epic 13: Egg System & Breeding Mechanics

## Epic Goal
Implement egg generation, hatching mechanics, breeding compatibility, egg moves, and Pokémon reproduction systems, enabling breeding-based gameplay and egg collection.

## Story 13.1: Breeding Compatibility & Egg Generation
As a **breeding system developer**,
I want **to implement breeding compatibility and egg generation mechanics**,
so that **compatible Pokémon can produce eggs with proper inheritance rules**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Breeding compatibility validates egg groups and species compatibility
2. Egg generation probability calculations match current breeding success rates
3. Gender requirements enforce proper male/female or Ditto breeding combinations
4. Breeding rejection handles incompatible pairs with appropriate messaging
5. Egg production timing follows proper breeding cycles and intervals
6. Special breeding cases (Ditto, genderless Pokémon) function correctly
7. Breeding environment requirements (Day Care, breeding centers) validated properly
8. Egg species determination follows proper inheritance rules from parents

## Story 13.2: Genetic Inheritance System
As a **genetics specialist**,
I want **to implement IV inheritance, nature passing, and ability inheritance**,
so that **bred Pokémon inherit traits from parents with proper probability distributions**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. IV inheritance passes 3 random IVs from parents to offspring
2. Nature inheritance uses proper probability with Everstone item effects
3. Ability inheritance follows species-specific ability passing rules
4. Hidden ability inheritance occurs at appropriate rates when parents have hidden abilities
5. Shiny inheritance follows proper shiny breeding mechanics and rates
6. Ball inheritance passes appropriate Pokéball types from female parent
7. Form inheritance maintains proper form passing for species with multiple forms
8. Breeding item effects (Destiny Knot, Power items) modify inheritance correctly

## Story 13.3: Egg Move System
As a **egg move specialist**,
I want **to implement egg moves that offspring can learn from parents**,
so that **bred Pokémon can know moves they couldn't learn normally through unique combinations**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Egg move compatibility validates which moves can be passed to offspring
2. Egg move learning requires appropriate parent to know the move
3. Egg move combinations allow learning multiple egg moves from different parents
4. Egg move priority determines which moves are learned when moveset is full
5. Egg move inheritance works with both parents contributing potential moves
6. Special egg move cases (chain breeding, move tutors) function properly
7. Egg move validation prevents impossible or illegal move combinations
8. Egg move display shows inherited moves clearly in offspring moveset

## Story 13.4: Egg Hatching & Incubation
As a **hatching system developer**,
I want **to implement egg hatching mechanics with proper step counting and care**,
so that **eggs hatch after appropriate incubation periods with proper timing**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Egg step counting tracks distance/steps required for hatching accurately
2. Egg hatching cycles vary by species with appropriate time requirements
3. Egg care mechanics (keeping in party) affect hatching speed appropriately
4. Hatching process reveals offspring with proper stats and characteristics
5. Egg hatching notifications alert players when eggs are ready to hatch
6. Multiple egg management handles several eggs incubating simultaneously
7. Egg abandonment or release prevents indefinite egg accumulation
8. Hatched Pokémon initialization sets up proper stats, moves, and characteristics
