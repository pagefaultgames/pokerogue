# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Transform PokéRogue into a high-performance, cache-optimized game engine using Entity-Component-System architecture
- Achieve 10x performance improvements through SIMD vectorization and data-oriented design patterns
- Create the world's first decentralized roguelike optimized for autonomous agent participation on Arweave AO
- Establish a greenfield foundation that eliminates all legacy architectural technical debt
- Enable massive scalability through cache-efficient component processing and parallel system execution
- Demonstrate cutting-edge ECS patterns that can serve as reference architecture for future games

## Background Context

PokéRogue represents a revolutionary leap from traditional object-oriented game architecture to a pure Entity-Component-System implementation optimized for the Arweave AO protocol. This greenfield approach eliminates the constraints of legacy migration, enabling the implementation of cutting-edge performance optimizations including SIMD vectorization, cache-friendly memory layouts, and data-oriented design patterns.

The ECS HyperBeam architecture addresses fundamental performance bottlenecks in traditional game engines by treating data and behavior as separate concerns, allowing for unprecedented optimization opportunities. This approach enables the game to process thousands of entities simultaneously while maintaining real-time responsiveness, positioning PokéRogue as the first truly performance-optimized decentralized game.
