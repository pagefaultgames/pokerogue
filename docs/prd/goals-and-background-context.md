# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
Based on your Project Brief, here are the key desired outcomes this PRD will deliver:

• **Complete AO-Native Game Engine Migration** - Achieve 100% functional parity with current PokéRogue on AO processes with zero game mechanics lost
• **Establish Permanent Save System** - Eliminate save corruption and enable cross-device gameplay through AO process persistence  
• **Enable Autonomous Agent Integration** - Create first UI-agnostic roguelike where AI agents can participate as first-class players
• **Demonstrate AO Gaming Feasibility** - Prove complex game logic can operate effectively on AO protocol at scale
• **Build Decentralized Gaming Foundation** - Remove centralized server dependencies while maintaining player experience
• **Create Open Source Reference** - Establish reproducible workflow for AO game development that other projects can adopt

## Background Context

This PRD addresses the fundamental limitation that PokéRogue, as a browser-dependent centralized game, excludes the growing ecosystem of autonomous AI agents from participation. The current architecture creates fragile save systems (15-20% of players lose progress), requires centralized servers, and prevents the emerging market of 500+ AO agent developers from building gaming integrations.

The migration strategy leverages AO's turn-based message-passing architecture to solve these problems through a three-phase approach: first migrating game mechanics to AO handlers for permanent storage and reliability, then integrating the existing UI through AOConnect, and finally enabling AI agents to participate alongside human players in a truly decentralized PVPVE environment.
