# Epic 14: Egg System & Breeding Mechanics

Implement comprehensive Pokemon breeding system including breeding compatibility, genetic inheritance, egg moves, hatching mechanics, and incubation systems using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete Pokemon breeding and egg systems by extending Pokemon Data (Epic 3) with breeding mechanics, genetic calculations, egg management, and hatching processes using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript breeding systems.
