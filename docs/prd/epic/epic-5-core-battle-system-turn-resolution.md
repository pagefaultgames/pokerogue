# Epic 5: Core Battle System & Turn Resolution

Implement comprehensive turn-based battle engine with damage calculation, battle state management, and victory/defeat conditions using Rust NIF systems integrated with Pokemon data and move systems within the Bevy ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish the complete turn-based battle engine by integrating Pokemon data systems (Epic 3) and move mechanics (Epic 4) into a unified battle processing framework with Rust NIF systems and Bevy ECS, achieving type-safe battle logic and maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript battle implementation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based battle engine with turn processing, damage calculations, battle state management
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Rust WASM devices, Pokemon data foundation, move system infrastructure
- Integration points: Pokemon species/instances (Epic 3), move database/mechanics (Epic 4), battle UI, game state persistence

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Complete battle engine migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with ECS battle state management
- How it integrates: Battle WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, consuming Pokemon and move data, producing battle outcomes
- Success criteria: 100% battle parity + type-safe battle logic + real-time battle processing + seamless Epic 3/4 integration

## Stories

### Story 5.1: Battle State Management in GameState Structure
As a **battle state developer**,  
I want **comprehensive battle state management within GameState with battle entities and turn tracking**,  
so that **battle sessions can be serialized, managed, and processed through GameState NIF boundaries**.

### Story 5.2: Turn Processing Engine NIF with Internal ECS
As a **turn system developer**,  
I want **Rust NIF system for turn processing using GameState input and internal Bevy ECS calculations**,  
so that **battle turns execute with correct Pokemon speed mechanics and maintain perfect turn order parity**.

### Story 5.3: Damage Calculation Engine with GameState Integration
As a **battle mechanics developer**,  
I want **integrated damage calculation NIF using GameState Pokemon data and move effectiveness**,  
so that **battle damage is calculated using GameState serialization with internal ECS processing for type-safe calculations**.

### Story 5.4: Battle Action Processing & Move Execution Framework
As a **battle action developer**,  
I want **comprehensive battle action processing system handling move execution, target selection, and effect application**,  
so that **Pokemon moves execute correctly with proper targeting, damage application, and effect processing**.

### Story 5.5: Battle State Transitions & Victory/Defeat Conditions
As a **battle outcome developer**,  
I want **battle state transition management with victory conditions, defeat detection, and battle resolution**,  
so that **battles conclude correctly with proper winner determination and experience/reward distribution**.

### Story 5.6: Battle System Integration Testing & Performance Validation
As a **battle QA developer**,  
I want **comprehensive battle system testing comparing TypeScript vs Rust battle outcomes**,  
so that **100% battle parity is verified across all battle scenarios with performance optimization validation**.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing battle ECS component interfaces remain unchanged for UI and game state integration
- [x] Battle outcome API compatibility maintained for experience, rewards, and progression systems  
- [x] Pokemon battle data integration seamless with Epic 3 Pokemon instances and Epic 4 move data
- [x] Battle state persistence follows existing save/load patterns with ECS state management
- [x] Performance improvements through type-safe battle processing and optimized turn calculations

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Battle system integration breaks existing combat balance and battle outcome consistency
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive battle parity testing with TypeScript reference and gradual battle scenario validation
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to TypeScript battle engine while maintaining ECS battle state and Pokemon/move data integration

- [x] Epic 3 Pokemon data integration verified for all battle scenarios
- [x] Epic 4 move system integration verified for all move types and effects
- [x] Documentation updated for complete battle system architecture and integration patterns
- [x] No regression in existing battle-dependent features and progression systems

## Integration Architecture

**HyperBeam Battle Integration:**
- Battle ECS components managed by HyperBeam world state (BattleSession, BattleParticipant, TurnQueue)
- Battle WASM devices registered in device orchestration framework
- Message routing for battle operations (turn processing, damage calculation, state transitions)

**Pokemon Data Integration (Epic 3 Dependency):**
- Pokemon instance data consumption for battle participants
- Pokemon stats, abilities, and nature effects integrated into battle calculations
- Pokemon state modifications (HP, status effects, stat changes) managed through ECS components

**Move System Integration (Epic 4 Dependency):**
- Move data and mechanics consumed from Epic 4 move database and WASM devices
- Type effectiveness calculations integrated into damage processing
- Move effects and special mechanics applied through battle action framework

**Battle Processing Flow:**
```
Battle Start → Pokemon/Move Data Load → Turn Priority Calculation → Action Selection → 
Move Execution → Damage/Effect Application → State Update → Victory Check → Next Turn/End Battle
```

**Device Communication Pattern:**
```
HyperBeam Battle State → Pokemon Data (Epic 3) → Move Data (Epic 4) → Battle WASM Device → 
Battle Outcome → ECS State Update → UI/Game State Notification
```

**Dependency Chain:**
- Requires: Epic 3 (Pokemon Data System) - COMPLETED ✅
- Requires: Epic 4 (Pokemon Move System) - COMPLETED ✅  
- Enables: Epic 6+ (Status Effects), Epic 8 (Player Progression), Epic 10+ (Advanced Battle Systems)
- Critical Foundation: All Pokemon-related battle functionality depends on Epic 5 completion

## Technical Validation Criteria

**Battle Performance Validation:**
- Turn processing: <100ms average per turn including all calculations
- Damage calculations: <50ms per move execution including type effectiveness
- Battle state updates: <25ms for ECS component modifications and persistence
- Complete battle: <5s processing time for typical 10-turn battle scenario

**Integration Parity Validation:**
- Pokemon stat usage: 100% identical to TypeScript implementation across all battle calculations
- Move damage outcomes: 100% identical including all modifier effects and type interactions
- Turn order processing: 100% identical speed calculations and priority resolution
- Battle state transitions: 100% identical victory/defeat conditions and battle flow

**Data Integration Validation:**
- Epic 3 Pokemon data: All Pokemon instances properly integrated with battle participant management
- Epic 4 Move data: All move types and effects properly integrated with battle action processing
- External data performance: Pokemon and move data loading optimized for real-time battle requirements
- State consistency: Battle state changes properly synchronized with Pokemon instance modifications

**Type Safety & Reliability Validation:**
- Zero unsafe Rust operations in all battle WASM devices
- Compile-time validation of battle state boundaries, damage ranges, and turn processing
- Memory safety guarantees for battle session lifecycle and participant data management
- Error handling for all battle edge cases and invalid state transitions

**Battle Scenario Coverage:**
- Single battles: 1v1 Pokemon battles with all move types and basic mechanics
- Status effect battles: Battles involving poison, paralysis, sleep, and other status conditions  
- Type effectiveness battles: Battles testing all type matchups and damage multipliers
- Multi-turn battles: Extended battles testing turn ordering, PP management, and battle endurance
