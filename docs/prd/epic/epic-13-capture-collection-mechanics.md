# Epic 13: Capture & Collection Mechanics

Implement comprehensive Pokemon capture mechanics including wild encounters, Pokeball systems, capture calculations, PC storage, party management, and collection tracking using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete Pokemon capture and collection systems by integrating capture mechanics, encounter systems, storage management, and collection tracking with Pokemon Data (Epic 3) and Item Systems (Epic 9) using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript capture systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based wild encounters, capture mechanics, Pokeball effects, PC storage, party management
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Pokemon Data System (Epic 3), Item System (Epic 9), Core Battle System (Epic 5), Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Wild Pokemon generation, capture rate calculation, storage system integration, collection progress tracking

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Capture and collection system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with ECS capture management
- How it integrates: Capture WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 3 Pokemon data, Epic 9 items, and Epic 5 battles
- Success criteria: 100% capture parity + type-safe capture processing + seamless multi-system integration
