# Epic 1: HyperBeam Foundation & Security

Establish foundational HyperBeam process architecture with ECS world state, device orchestration framework, and security systems for type-safe game logic processing and anti-cheat validation.

## Story 1.1: HyperBeam Process Architecture Setup
As a **systems architect**,  
I want **a foundational HyperBeam process with ECS world state and HTTP server**,  
so that **game entities, components, and player sessions can be managed with device integration**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. HyperBeam process initializes with ECS world containing entity manager and component storage
2. HTTP server provides endpoints for game actions, state queries, and device communication
3. ECS entity creation, modification, and deletion operations function correctly
4. Component systems for Pokemon, Player, Battle, and World entities work as expected
5. Process state persistence with Arweave integration maintains data integrity
6. Bundle optimization achieves <500KB target through external data references
7. Process deployment succeeds within AO platform constraints and resource limits
8. Basic health checks and world state validation ensure system reliability

## Story 1.2: Device Orchestration Framework
As a **device integration developer**,  
I want **comprehensive device registry and message routing system**,  
so that **Rust WASM devices can be discovered, versioned, and orchestrated reliably**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Device registry manages available Rust WASM devices with semantic versioning
2. Message routing directs game actions to appropriate devices based on capability
3. Device lifecycle management handles loading, unloading, and hot-swapping
4. Error handling and timeout management for device communication failures
5. Device health monitoring with performance metrics and availability tracking
6. Message queuing ensures proper ordering and delivery of device requests
7. Device capability discovery allows dynamic feature detection
8. Integration testing validates device communication under concurrent load

## Story 1.3: Security Framework & Anti-Cheat Foundation
As a **security engineer**,  
I want **comprehensive security validation and anti-cheat detection systems**,  
so that **game state integrity is maintained and cheating attempts are prevented**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Game state validation ensures all entity modifications follow game rules
2. Anti-cheat detection identifies impossible stat changes, invalid moves, and resource manipulation
3. Rate limiting prevents abuse of game actions and API endpoints
4. Cryptographic validation for critical game state changes and transactions
5. Input sanitization and validation for all player actions and device responses
6. Audit logging tracks all game state modifications with player attribution
7. Security policy enforcement prevents unauthorized access to sensitive operations
8. Integration with Arweave provides immutable audit trails for investigations

## Story 1.4: TypeScript Reference Preservation & Parity Framework
As a **quality assurance engineer**,  
I want **automated parity testing framework comparing TypeScript reference with HyperBeam implementation**,  
so that **100% functional equivalence is maintained throughout migration**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. TypeScript reference implementation preserved in `/typescript-reference/` directory
2. Automated test framework executes identical scenarios on both implementations
3. Parity validation covers all game mechanics with comprehensive test coverage
4. Regression detection immediately identifies behavioral differences between systems
5. Performance benchmarking ensures HyperBeam meets or exceeds TypeScript performance
6. Test data generation creates exhaustive game scenarios for validation
7. Continuous integration enforces zero parity violations before deployment
8. Detailed reporting provides insights into system behavior and performance differences
