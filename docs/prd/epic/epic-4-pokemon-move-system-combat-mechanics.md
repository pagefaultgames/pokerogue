# Epic 4: Pokemon Move System & Combat Mechanics

Establish comprehensive Pokemon move database, type effectiveness calculations, and combat mechanics infrastructure with Rust WASM devices for type-safe move processing and battle preparation within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Migrate Pokemon move database, type effectiveness systems, move learning mechanics, and combat calculations to Rust WASM devices while achieving external data storage optimization and establishing the foundational move infrastructure required for the Core Battle System (Epic 5).

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based Pokemon move database, type effectiveness calculations, move learning systems
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Rust WASM devices, Arweave external storage, Pokemon data foundation (Epic 3)
- Integration points: Pokemon species data, battle system preparation, device registry, ECS move components

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Pokemon move system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with external move database storage
- How it integrates: Move WASM devices coordinated by HyperBeam with Pokemon data integration and battle system preparation
- Success criteria: 100% parity + external storage optimization + type-safe move mechanics + battle system readiness

## Stories

### Story 4.1: Pokemon Move Database Migration to Arweave
As a **move data migration developer**,  
I want **Pokemon move database migrated to Arweave external storage with efficient move reference system**,  
so that **move data contributes to bundle size reduction while enabling fast move lookup and battle preparation**.

### Story 4.2: Type Effectiveness & Damage Calculation WASM Device
As a **combat mechanics developer**,  
I want **Rust WASM device for type effectiveness calculations, STAB bonuses, and base damage computations**,  
so that **type-based combat mechanics are type-safe and maintain perfect parity with TypeScript calculations**.

### Story 4.3: Pokemon Move Learning & Moveset Management System
As a **Pokemon moveset developer**,  
I want **comprehensive move learning system with level-up, TM, breeding, and tutor move integration**,  
so that **Pokemon can learn moves correctly through all acquisition methods with proper validation**.

### Story 4.4: Move Effects & Special Mechanics WASM Device
As a **move effects developer**,  
I want **Rust WASM device for move effects, status infliction, stat modifications, and special move mechanics**,  
so that **complex move behaviors are type-safe and prepared for battle system integration**.

### Story 4.5: Combat Preparation & Battle Integration Framework
As a **battle integration developer**,  
I want **move system integration framework that prepares combat data for battle engine**,  
so that **Epic 5 battle system receives properly formatted move data and mechanics for seamless integration**.

### Story 4.6: Move System Parity Validation & Performance Testing
As a **QA validation developer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing suite comparing TypeScript vs Rust move system operations**,  
so that **100% functional parity is verified across all move mechanics and battle preparation systems**.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing Pokemon move ECS component interfaces remain unchanged for dependent systems
- [x] Move database API compatibility maintained for UI and battle system integration  
- [x] Type effectiveness calculations maintain exact floating-point precision with TypeScript
- [x] Move learning validation follows existing game rules without behavioral changes
- [x] Performance improvements through external data optimization and type-safe calculations

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Move system migration breaks Pokemon moveset validation and battle system compatibility
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive parity testing with TypeScript reference and staged integration with Pokemon data systems
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to TypeScript move systems while maintaining ECS component compatibility and Pokemon data integration

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 6 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Pokemon move database fully migrated to Arweave with external storage optimization
- [x] Type effectiveness and damage calculation WASM devices integrated with HyperBeam
- [x] Move learning system functioning with all acquisition methods (level, TM, breeding, tutor)
- [x] Move effects and special mechanics implemented with type-safe Rust logic
- [x] Battle integration framework prepared for Epic 5 implementation
- [x] 100% parity validation passed against TypeScript reference across all move operations
- [x] Performance benchmarks show external storage and computation improvements
- [x] Integration verified with Pokemon data systems and battle preparation
- [x] Documentation updated for move system architecture and battle integration readiness
- [x] No regression in existing Pokemon moveset or battle preparation functionality

## Integration Architecture

**HyperBeam Integration:**
- Move ECS components managed by HyperBeam world state
- Move WASM devices registered in device orchestration framework
- Message routing for move operations (effectiveness calculations, effect processing, learning validation)

**Pokemon Data Integration:**
- Seamless integration with Epic 3 Pokemon species and individual Pokemon systems
- Move learning validation against Pokemon species compatibility
- Moveset management coordinated with Pokemon instance data

**Battle System Preparation:**
- Move data formatting and validation for Epic 5 battle engine consumption
- Combat mechanics preparation (damage, effects, type interactions)
- Battle action translation from move selections to combat operations

**External Data Integration:**
- Arweave transactions store Pokemon move database (~1.5MB external)
- Move reference system with caching for performance optimization
- Type effectiveness matrices and move effect definitions externalized

**Device Communication Pattern:**
```
HyperBeam Process → Move Device Registry → Specific Move WASM Device → Combat Data → Battle System Preparation
```

**Dependency Chain:**
- Requires: Epic 3 (Pokemon Data System & Species Management) - IN PROGRESS
- Enables: Epic 5 (Core Battle System & Turn Resolution) - CRITICAL DEPENDENCY
- Supports: Epic 6+ (Status Effects), Epic 10+ (Advanced Combat Systems)

## Technical Validation Criteria

**External Storage Validation:**
- Move database external storage: ~1.5MB migrated to Arweave
- Move lookup performance: <50ms average for move data retrieval
- Type effectiveness calculations: <10ms for complete type interaction matrix
- External data loading: <3s for complete move database initialization

**Parity Validation:**
- Type effectiveness calculations: 100% identical results to TypeScript (exact floating-point)
- Move damage calculations: 100% identical including STAB, weakness, resistance
- Move learning validation: 100% identical move acquisition rules and restrictions
- Move effect processing: 100% identical status effects, stat modifications, special mechanics

**Battle Integration Validation:**
- Move data preparation: Complete move information formatted for battle system consumption
- Combat mechanics: All type interactions, damage calculations, and effects prepared
- Battle readiness: Epic 5 integration points fully satisfied and tested
- Performance optimization: Move system operations optimized for real-time battle processing

**Type Safety Validation:**
- Zero unsafe Rust operations in move WASM devices
- Compile-time validation of move ID boundaries, type effectiveness ranges, and damage calculations
- Memory safety guarantees for move data lifecycle and battle preparation processes
