# Epic 2: TDD Testing Suite & Validation Framework

Establish comprehensive Test-Driven Development infrastructure using aolite for AO process testing, aos-local for deployment validation, and Rust testing frameworks to validate TypeScriptâ†’Rust migration parity before implementation of any epic functionality.

## Story 2.1: aolite Unit Testing Framework for HyperBeam Lua Process
As a **TDD engineer**,

7. Process restart and recovery testing ensures state persistence and reliability
8. Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment validation

## Story 2.3: Rust WASM Device Unit Testing with cargo test
As a **Rust device developer**,  
I want **comprehensive cargo test framework for Rust WASM device logic with TypeScript parity validation**,  
so that **I can write failing Rust unit tests first, then implement device logic to pass tests**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. cargo test framework configured for Rust WASM device testing with wasm-pack integration
2. Property-based testing using proptest crate validates device logic across comprehensive input ranges
3. Unit tests with #[test] annotations cover all device functions with TDD test-first methodology
4. Benchmark testing using criterion crate measures device performance against TypeScript reference

6. Cross-compilation testing validates device functionality across target platforms (wasm32-unknown-unknown)
7. Memory safety testing ensures no unsafe operations or memory leaks in devices using miri
8. Serialization testing validates data integrity between HyperBeam and device communication using serde

## Story 2.4: TypeScript-Rust Parity Validation Suite
As a **parity validation specialist**,  
I want **comprehensive automated testing that validates 100% functional equivalence between TypeScript and Rust implementations**,  
so that **no behavioral differences exist between original and migrated code**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Golden master testing captures TypeScript outputs for identical inputs across all game mechanics
2. Regression testing automatically detects any behavioral changes during Rust migration
3. Equivalence testing validates mathematical calculations produce identical results (damage, stats, etc.)
4. Randomization testing ensures RNG produces identical sequences with same seeds
5. Edge case testing validates handling of boundary conditions and error states
6. Performance comparison testing ensures Rust implementation meets or exceeds TypeScript speed
7. State consistency testing validates ECS world state matches TypeScript game state
8. Comprehensive test coverage analysis ensures all code paths are validated

## Story 2.5: TDD Workflow Integration and Automation
As a **development process engineer**,  
I want **automated TDD workflow that enforces test-first development across all epics**,  
so that **no functionality is implemented without corresponding failing tests first**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pre-commit hooks prevent code commits without corresponding passing tests
2. CI/CD pipeline enforces TDD workflow with test-first validation gates
3. Test coverage reporting ensures minimum coverage thresholds for all components
4. Automated test generation creates skeleton tests for new functionality requirements
5. Test documentation generation provides clear specifications from test cases
6. Test result visualization shows TDD progress and identifies uncovered functionality
7. Integration with issue tracking links failing tests to development tasks
8. Developer tooling provides easy test running and debugging capabilities

## Story 2.6: Dual-Path Integration Testing Framework
As a **integration testing engineer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing that validates seamless communication between HyperBeam Lua process and Rust WASM devices**,  
so that **both paths work together correctly with 100% parity to TypeScript reference**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration tests validate message passing between HyperBeam Lua handlers and Rust WASM devices
2. Device orchestration testing ensures proper loading, registration, and communication of Rust devices
3. End-to-end game scenario testing validates complete workflows across both Lua process and Rust devices
4. State synchronization testing ensures ECS world state consistency across Lua-Rust boundaries
5. Performance testing validates that dual-path architecture meets or exceeds TypeScript performance
6. Error handling testing validates graceful degradation when devices fail or become unavailable
7. Serialization testing validates data integrity across HyperBeam-device communication boundaries
8. Parity testing ensures identical outcomes whether logic runs in Lua handlers or Rust devices

## Story 2.7: Continuous Integration Testing Pipeline
As a **CI/CD engineer**,  
I want **comprehensive automated testing pipeline that validates both Lua process (aolite/aos-local) and Rust device (cargo test) paths**,  
so that **quality gates prevent deployment of non-functional or non-parity code in either path**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-stage pipeline validates aolite unit tests, aos-local deployment, cargo test Rust devices, and integration testing
2. Parallel testing execution for both Lua and Rust paths reduces pipeline runtime while maintaining coverage
3. Quality gates prevent progression without passing tests in BOTH Lua handlers AND Rust devices
4. Test result aggregation provides comprehensive reporting across aolite, aos-local, cargo test, and integration frameworks
5. Notification system alerts developers of test failures with path-specific debugging information
6. Test artifact management stores results from both Lua process testing and Rust device testing
7. Environment management provides isolated testing environments for dual-path epic branches
8. Integration with code review process requires passing tests in both paths before merge approval

**Note: Complete epic details for all 26 epics will follow the same comprehensive story structure as Epic 1, with each epic containing 4-6 detailed stories covering specific game mechanics migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM devices while maintaining 100% parity.**

**Epic Summary Coverage:**
- **Epic 1**: Foundation (HyperBeam process, ECS world state, security framework)
- **Epic 2**: TDD Testing Suite (aolite, aos-local, Rust testing, parity validation) - **PREREQUISITE FOR ALL EPICS**
- **Epics 3-9**: Core foundational systems (Pokemon data, moves, battles, status, arena, progression, items)
- **Epics 10-15**: Advanced gameplay mechanics (fusion, forms, terastalization, capture, breeding, unlockables)  
- **Epics 16-22**: World and player systems (biomes, AI, challenges, encounters, events, gacha, tutorials)
- **Epics 23-27**: Analytics and deployment (pokedex, achievements, statistics, tracking, integration)

**TDD-First Development Approach:**
- **Epic 2 prerequisite**: All subsequent epics depend on comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Dual-path testing**: Both HyperBeam Lua processes (aolite/aos-local) AND Rust WASM devices (cargo test)
- **Test-first methodology**: Write failing tests before implementing any functionality
- **Parity validation**: Every feature validated against TypeScript reference using automated testing
- **Quality gates**: CI/CD prevents deployment without passing tests and 100% parity validation
- **Continuous validation**: Real-time testing ensures no regression during migration

**Each epic follows rigorous dual-path TDD workflow:**

**Path 1: HyperBeam Lua Process TDD**
1. **Write failing tests** using aolite unit testing framework for AO handlers
2. **Implement HyperBeam Lua handlers** to pass aolite tests
3. **Validate with aos-local** deployment testing for real AO environment compatibility
4. **Verify parity** against TypeScript reference through automated message testing

**Path 2: Rust WASM Device TDD**  
1. **Write failing tests** using cargo test for device logic and parity validation
2. **Implement Rust WASM devices** to pass unit tests and property-based testing
3. **Validate with wasm-pack** for WASM compilation and browser compatibility
4. **Verify parity** against TypeScript reference through mathematical/behavioral equivalence

**Integration validation:**
- Device orchestration testing ensures seamless communication between HyperBeam process and Rust devices
- End-to-end testing validates complete game scenarios using both paths
- Bundle optimization through external Arweave data storage
