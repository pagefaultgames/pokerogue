## Story 2.3: Rust NIF System Unit Testing with cargo test
As a **Rust NIF developer**,

6. Internal Bevy ECS testing ensures proper World creation and component manipulation
7. Memory safety testing ensures no unsafe operations in GameState serialization using miri
8. Serialization testing validates GameState JSON integrity across Lua-Rust boundaries using serde

## Story 2.4: Phaser/TypeScript-GameState Parity Validation Suite
As a **parity validation specialist**,  
I want **comprehensive automated testing that validates 100% functional equivalence between original Phaser/TypeScript and GameState NIF implementations**,  
so that **no behavioral differences exist between original Pok√©Rogue and migrated AO version**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Golden master testing** captures Phaser/TypeScript outputs for identical inputs across all game mechanics
2. **Regression testing** automatically detects any behavioral changes during GameState migration  
3. **Mathematical equivalence** validates calculations produce identical results (damage, stats, evolution, etc.)
4. **RNG parity testing** ensures deterministic randomness produces identical sequences with same seeds
5. **Edge case testing** validates boundary conditions and error states match original behavior
6. **Performance comparison** ensures GameState NIF implementation meets or exceeds Phaser performance
7. **State consistency testing** validates GameState transformations match original TypeScript game state
8. **Battle outcome parity** validates 100% identical battle results between implementations

## Story 2.5: TDD Workflow Integration and Automation
As a **development process engineer**,  
I want **automated TDD workflow that enforces test-first development across all epics**,  
so that **no functionality is implemented without corresponding failing tests first**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Pre-commit hooks prevent code commits without corresponding passing tests
2. CI/CD pipeline enforces TDD workflow with test-first validation gates
3. Test coverage reporting ensures minimum coverage thresholds for all components
4. Automated test generation creates skeleton tests for new functionality requirements
5. Test documentation generation provides clear specifications from test cases
6. Test result visualization shows TDD progress and identifies uncovered functionality
7. Integration with issue tracking links failing tests to development tasks
8. Developer tooling provides easy test running and debugging capabilities

## Story 2.6: Dual-Path Integration Testing Framework
As a **integration testing engineer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing that validates seamless communication between HyperBeam Lua process and Rust WASM devices**,  
so that **both paths work together correctly with 100% parity to TypeScript reference**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration tests validate message passing between HyperBeam Lua handlers and Rust WASM devices
2. Device orchestration testing ensures proper loading, registration, and communication of Rust devices
3. End-to-end game scenario testing validates complete workflows across both Lua process and Rust devices
4. State synchronization testing ensures ECS world state consistency across Lua-Rust boundaries
5. Performance testing validates that dual-path architecture meets or exceeds TypeScript performance
6. Error handling testing validates graceful degradation when devices fail or become unavailable
7. Serialization testing validates data integrity across HyperBeam-device communication boundaries
8. Parity testing ensures identical outcomes whether logic runs in Lua handlers or Rust devices

## Story 2.7: Continuous Integration Testing Pipeline
As a **CI/CD engineer**,  
I want **comprehensive automated testing pipeline that validates both Lua process (aolite/aos-local) and Rust device (cargo test) paths**,  
so that **quality gates prevent deployment of non-functional or non-parity code in either path**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-stage pipeline validates aolite unit tests, aos-local deployment, cargo test Rust devices, and integration testing
2. Parallel testing execution for both Lua and Rust paths reduces pipeline runtime while maintaining coverage
3. Quality gates prevent progression without passing tests in BOTH Lua handlers AND Rust devices
4. Test result aggregation provides comprehensive reporting across aolite, aos-local, cargo test, and integration frameworks
5. Notification system alerts developers of test failures with path-specific debugging information
6. Test artifact management stores results from both Lua process testing and Rust device testing
7. Environment management provides isolated testing environments for dual-path epic branches
8. Integration with code review process requires passing tests in both paths before merge approval

**Note: Complete epic details for all 26 epics will follow the same comprehensive story structure as Epic 1, with each epic containing 4-6 detailed stories covering specific game mechanics migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM devices while maintaining 100% parity.**

**Epic Summary Coverage:**
- **Epic 1**: Foundation (HyperBeam process, ECS world state, security framework)
- **Epic 2**: TDD Testing Suite (aolite, aos-local, Rust testing, parity validation) - **PREREQUISITE FOR ALL EPICS**
- **Epics 3-9**: Core foundational systems (Pokemon data, moves, battles, status, arena, progression, items)
- **Epics 10-15**: Advanced gameplay mechanics (fusion, forms, terastalization, capture, breeding, unlockables)  
- **Epics 16-22**: World and player systems (biomes, AI, challenges, encounters, events, gacha, tutorials)
- **Epics 23-27**: Analytics and deployment (pokedex, achievements, statistics, tracking, integration)

**TDD-First Development Approach:**
- **Epic 2 prerequisite**: All subsequent epics depend on comprehensive testing infrastructure
- **Dual-path testing**: Both HyperBeam Lua processes (aolite/aos-local) AND Rust WASM devices (cargo test)
- **Test-first methodology**: Write failing tests before implementing any functionality
- **Parity validation**: Every feature validated against TypeScript reference using automated testing
- **Quality gates**: CI/CD prevents deployment without passing tests and 100% parity validation
- **Continuous validation**: Real-time testing ensures no regression during migration

**Each epic follows rigorous dual-path TDD workflow:**

**Path 1: HyperBeam Lua Process TDD**
1. **Write failing tests** using aolite unit testing framework for AO handlers
2. **Implement HyperBeam Lua handlers** to pass aolite tests
3. **Validate with aos-local** deployment testing for real AO environment compatibility
4. **Verify parity** against TypeScript reference through automated message testing

**Path 2: Rust WASM Device TDD**  
1. **Write failing tests** using cargo test for device logic and parity validation
2. **Implement Rust WASM devices** to pass unit tests and property-based testing
3. **Validate with wasm-pack** for WASM compilation and browser compatibility
4. **Verify parity** against TypeScript reference through mathematical/behavioral equivalence

**Integration validation:**
- Device orchestration testing ensures seamless communication between HyperBeam process and Rust devices
- End-to-end testing validates complete game scenarios using both paths
