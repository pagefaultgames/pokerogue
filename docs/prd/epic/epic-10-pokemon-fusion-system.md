# Epic 10: Pokemon Fusion System

Implement comprehensive Pokemon fusion mechanics including fusion creation, battle integration, evolution/form changes, and separation management using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete Pokemon fusion systems by extending Pokemon Data (Epic 3) with fusion creation mechanics, fused Pokemon battle integration, and fusion management using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript fusion systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based Pokemon fusion, fused Pokemon management, fusion battle mechanics
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Pokemon Data System (Epic 3), Core Battle System (Epic 5), Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Pokemon instance management, battle system integration, fusion state tracking, evolution compatibility

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Pokemon fusion system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with ECS fusion management
- How it integrates: Fusion WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 3 Pokemon data and Epic 5 battle processing
- Success criteria: 100% fusion parity + type-safe fusion processing + seamless Pokemon/battle integration
