# Epic 11: Dynamic Form Change System

Implement comprehensive dynamic form change mechanics including conditional transformations, move-based changes, temporary vs permanent forms, and form-specific stat/ability management using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete dynamic form change systems by extending Pokemon Data (Epic 3) with conditional form triggers, battle-based transformations, and form state management using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript form systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based form changes, conditional triggers, battle transformations
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Pokemon Data System (Epic 3), Core Battle System (Epic 5), Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Pokemon state management, battle condition triggers, form-specific data, ability changes

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Dynamic form change system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with ECS form management
- How it integrates: Form change WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 3 Pokemon data and Epic 5 battle triggers
- Success criteria: 100% form change parity + type-safe transformation processing + seamless Pokemon/battle integration
