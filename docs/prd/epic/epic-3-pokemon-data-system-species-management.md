# Epic 3: Pokemon Data System & Species Management

Establish comprehensive Pokemon data infrastructure with embedded species database, individual Pokemon instance management, and Bevy ECS component integration for type-safe Pokemon operations within the single-process NIF architecture.

## Epic Goal

Migrate Pokemon species database, abilities, nature/IV systems, and individual Pokemon instance management to Bevy ECS components and NIF systems with embedded game data, maintaining compact bundle size and achieving 100% functional parity with TypeScript implementation.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based Pokemon species data, stat calculations, individual Pokemon instances
- Technology stack: Single AO process, Bevy ECS, Rust NIF systems, embedded game data
- Integration points: NIF systems, ECS components and resources, embedded data structures

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Pokemon data system migration from TypeScript to Bevy ECS components with NIF systems
- How it integrates: Pokemon data as Bevy Resources, Pokemon instances as ECS entities with components
- Success criteria: 100% parity + compact embedded data + type-safe Pokemon operations

## Stories

### Story 3.1: Pokemon Species Database in GameState Structure
As a **data systems developer**,  
I want **Pokemon species data embedded in GameState with efficient lookup structures**,  
so that **species data is self-contained and serializes efficiently across NIF boundaries**.

### Story 3.2: Pokemon Statistics & Nature NIF System with GameState
As a **Pokemon mechanics developer**,  
I want **Rust NIF system for Pokemon stat calculations using GameState input and internal Bevy ECS**,  
so that **stat computations are type-safe and maintain parity with TypeScript implementation**.

### Story 3.3: Pokemon GameState Component Management
As a **Pokemon state developer**,  
I want **Pokemon data organized in GameState with entity-component mapping**,  
so that **Pokemon entities can be serialized, converted to internal ECS, and managed efficiently**.

### Story 3.4: Pokemon Ability System with GameState Integration
As a **Pokemon ability developer**,  
I want **comprehensive ability system with GameState ability data and NIF processing**,  
so that **Pokemon abilities function correctly with GameState serialization and maintain gameplay parity**.

### Story 3.5: Pokemon GameState Integration Testing & Parity Validation
As a **QA validation developer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing suite comparing TypeScript vs GameState Pokemon data operations**,  
so that **100% functional parity is verified across all Pokemon GameState transformations**.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing Pokemon ECS component interfaces remain unchanged for dependent systems
- [x] Pokemon data API compatibility maintained for battle system integration  
- [x] Database schema changes use external references without breaking existing queries
- [x] UI Pokemon display follows existing patterns with optimized data loading
- [x] Performance impact shows improvement through bundle size reduction and type safety

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Pokemon data migration breaks existing battle system dependencies and stat calculations
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive parity testing with TypeScript reference implementation and staged rollout
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to TypeScript Pokemon systems while maintaining ECS component compatibility

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 5 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Pokemon species database fully migrated to Arweave with <500KB bundle impact
- [x] Rust WASM Pokemon devices integrated with HyperBeam orchestration
- [x] Individual Pokemon instance management working within ECS architecture
- [x] Ability system functioning with type-safe Rust implementation
- [x] 100% parity validation passed against TypeScript reference
- [x] Performance benchmarks show bundle size and computation improvements
- [x] Integration points verified with battle system and UI components
- [x] Documentation updated for Pokemon data architecture and device usage
- [x] No regression in existing Pokemon-dependent functionality

## Integration Architecture

**HyperBeam Integration:**
- Pokemon ECS components managed by HyperBeam world state
- Pokemon WASM devices registered in device orchestration framework
- Message routing for Pokemon operations (stat calculations, ability triggers, evolution checks)

**External Data Integration:**
- Arweave transactions store Pokemon species database (~2MB external)
- Efficient reference system with caching for performance
- Data validation ensures integrity between external storage and device operations

**Device Communication Pattern:**
```
HyperBeam Process → Pokemon Device Registry → Specific Pokemon WASM Device → Result → ECS Component Update
```

**Dependency Chain:**
- Requires: Epic 1 (HyperBeam Foundation & Device Orchestration) - COMPLETED
- Enables: Epic 5 (Core Battle System), Epic 8 (Player Progression), Epic 10-14 (Advanced Pokemon Systems)
- Blocks: All Pokemon-dependent epics until completion

## Technical Validation Criteria

**Bundle Size Validation:**
- HyperBeam process bundle: <500KB (95% reduction from 2MB+ Pokemon data external migration)
- External data loading: <2s for complete species database initialization
- Individual Pokemon operations: <100ms average response time

**Parity Validation:**
- Stat calculation outcomes: 100% identical to TypeScript implementation
- Nature effect applications: 100% identical across all natures
- IV/EV calculations: 100% identical with floating-point precision
- Ability trigger conditions: 100% identical behavior

**Type Safety Validation:**
- Zero unsafe Rust operations in Pokemon WASM devices
- Compile-time validation of all Pokemon stat boundaries and type constraints
- Memory safety guarantees for Pokemon instance lifecycle management
