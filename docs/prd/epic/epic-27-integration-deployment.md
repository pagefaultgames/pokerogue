# Epic 27: Integration & Deployment

Implement comprehensive HyperBeam-AO integration including device orchestration, performance optimization, production deployment, and complete system integration using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Complete the PokéRogue ECS HyperBeam transformation by establishing full system integration, deployment orchestration, and production optimization while ensuring all epic systems work cohesively using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript systems.

## Epic Description

**Final Integration Context:**
- Current state: All 26 epics implemented with individual WASM devices and ECS integration
- Technology stack: Complete HyperBeam ECS architecture with full Rust WASM device ecosystem
- Integration scope: Cross-epic system coordination, deployment automation, performance optimization, production readiness

**Final Enhancement Goals:**
- Complete system integration across all 26 epic systems
- Production deployment with AO platform optimization
- Performance validation and system-wide optimization
- Full migration parity validation across entire application
