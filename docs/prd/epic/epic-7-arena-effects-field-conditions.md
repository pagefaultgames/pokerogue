# Epic 7: Arena Effects & Field Conditions

Implement comprehensive arena effects including entry hazards, field conditions, side-specific effects, and positional battle mechanics using Rust WASM devices integrated with environmental systems within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete arena effect and field condition systems by extending Environmental Systems (Epic 6) with entry hazards, battlefield positioning, side-specific effects, and arena-based battle mechanics using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript arena systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based entry hazards (spikes, stealth rock), field conditions (reflect, light screen), positional mechanics
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Environmental Systems (Epic 6), Core Battle System (Epic 5), Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Environmental system integration, battle positioning, side-based effect tracking, hazard damage calculation

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Arena effect and field condition migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with environmental integration
- How it integrates: Arena WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 6 environmental systems and Epic 5 battle processing
- Success criteria: 100% arena effect parity + type-safe field condition processing + seamless environmental integration

## Stories

### Story 7.1: Entry Hazard System & Battlefield Positioning
As a **arena mechanics developer**,  
I want **comprehensive entry hazard system with battlefield positioning and damage calculation integration**,  
so that **Pokemon switching triggers appropriate hazard damage with proper type effectiveness and stacking mechanics**.

### Story 7.2: Field Condition Management & Side-Specific Effects
As a **field condition developer**,  
I want **complete field condition system with side-specific effects, duration tracking, and battle integration**,  
so that **protective and enhancement effects properly influence battle outcomes with correct application rules**.

### Story 7.3: Arena Effect Processing WASM Device Implementation
As a **arena processing developer**,  
I want **Rust WASM device for arena effect processing including hazard calculation and field condition application**,  
so that **arena effects execute with type-safe logic and maintain perfect parity with TypeScript arena mechanics**.

### Story 7.4: Positional Battle Mechanics & Arena Interaction System
As a **positional mechanics developer**,  
I want **battlefield positioning system with arena interactions and positional effect processing**,  
so that **Pokemon positioning influences battle mechanics and arena effects apply correctly based on battlefield location**.

### Story 7.5: Arena Integration with Environmental & Battle Systems
As a **arena integration developer**,  
I want **seamless arena system integration with Epic 6 environmental systems and Epic 5 battle processing**,  
so that **arena effects coordinate with environmental conditions and battle flow for complete battlefield simulation**.

### Story 7.6: Arena System Parity Validation & Performance Testing
As a **arena QA developer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing suite comparing TypeScript vs Rust arena system outcomes**,  
so that **100% functional parity is verified across all arena effects and field conditions with performance optimization**.

## Compatibility Requirements

## Integration Architecture

**HyperBeam Arena Integration:**
- Arena ECS components managed by HyperBeam world state (EntryHazard, FieldCondition, ArenaPosition)
- Arena WASM devices registered in device orchestration framework
- Message routing for arena operations (hazard processing, field condition application, positional effects)

**Environmental System Integration (Epic 6 Dependency):**
- Arena effects coordinate with Epic 6 environmental conditions for complete battlefield simulation
- Field conditions interact with weather and terrain effects for combined environmental impact
- Arena positioning influences environmental effect application and intensity

**Battle System Integration (Epic 5 Dependency):**
- Arena effects integrated with Epic 5 battle turn processing and damage calculation
- Entry hazards trigger during Pokemon switching with proper battle flow integration
- Field conditions modify battle calculations and move effectiveness

**Arena Processing Flow:**
```
Pokemon Action → Arena Position Check → Entry Hazard Activation → Field Condition Application → 
Environmental Coordination → Battle Calculation Modification → Arena State Update
```

**Device Communication Pattern:**
```
HyperBeam Battle State → Arena Condition Data → Arena WASM Device → 
Arena Effects → Environmental System Coordination → Battle System Integration
```

**Dependency Chain:**
- Requires: Epic 6 (Status Effects & Environmental Systems) - COMPLETED ✅
- Requires: Epic 5 (Core Battle System & Turn Resolution) - COMPLETED ✅
- Enables: Epic 10+ (Advanced Arena Systems), Epic 17 (Trainer & AI Systems)
