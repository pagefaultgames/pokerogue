# Epic 6: Status Effects & Environmental Systems

Implement comprehensive Pokemon status conditions, weather systems, terrain effects, and environmental interactions using Rust WASM devices integrated with the core battle system within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete status effect and environmental systems by extending the Core Battle System (Epic 5) with status condition processing, weather mechanics, terrain effects, and environmental interactions using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript environmental systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based status effects (poison, paralysis, sleep), weather systems (rain, sun, sandstorm), terrain effects
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Core Battle System (Epic 5), Pokemon data foundation, Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Battle engine integration, Pokemon state management, turn processing, environmental condition tracking

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Status effect and environmental system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with battle system integration
- How it integrates: Environmental WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 5 battle processing
- Success criteria: 100% status/environmental parity + type-safe condition processing + seamless battle integration

## Stories

### Story 6.1: Pokemon Status Condition System & ECS Integration
As a **status effect developer**,  
I want **comprehensive Pokemon status condition management with ECS components and battle integration**,  
so that **Pokemon can be afflicted with status conditions that properly affect battle calculations and turn processing**.

### Story 6.2: Status Effect Processing WASM Device Implementation
As a **status mechanics developer**,  
I want **Rust WASM device for status effect processing including damage, healing, and battle impact calculations**,  
so that **status conditions execute with type-safe logic and maintain perfect parity with TypeScript status mechanics**.

### Story 6.3: Weather System & Environmental Condition Management
As a **weather system developer**,  
I want **comprehensive weather and environmental condition system with battle integration and turn-based processing**,  
so that **weather effects influence battles correctly with proper duration tracking and effect application**.

### Story 6.4: Terrain Effects & Field Condition WASM Device
As a **terrain mechanics developer**,  
I want **Rust WASM device for terrain effects, field conditions, and environmental interactions**,  
so that **battlefield environmental effects are processed with type safety and integrated with battle outcomes**.

### Story 6.5: Environmental Integration with Battle System & Turn Processing
As a **battle integration developer**,  
I want **seamless environmental system integration with Epic 5 battle engine and turn processing**,  
so that **status effects and environmental conditions properly influence battle flow and Pokemon interactions**.

### Story 6.6: Status & Environmental System Parity Validation
As a **environmental QA developer**,  
I want **comprehensive testing suite comparing TypeScript vs Rust environmental system outcomes**,  
so that **100% functional parity is verified across all status conditions and environmental effects**.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing status effect ECS components remain unchanged for battle system and UI integration
- [x] Environmental condition API compatibility maintained for weather/terrain dependent systems
- [x] Status effect duration and interaction logic maintains exact parity with TypeScript implementation
- [x] Environmental condition stacking and interaction rules follow existing game mechanics
- [x] Performance improvements through type-safe environmental processing and optimized condition tracking

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Environmental system migration breaks existing status effect interactions and battle condition logic
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive environmental parity testing with TypeScript reference and staged integration with battle system
**Rollback Plan:** Revert to TypeScript environmental systems while maintaining ECS environmental components and battle integration

## Integration Architecture

**HyperBeam Environmental Integration:**
- Environmental ECS components managed by HyperBeam world state (WeatherCondition, TerrainEffect, StatusCondition)
- Environmental WASM devices registered in device orchestration framework
- Message routing for environmental operations (status processing, weather effects, terrain interactions)

**Battle System Integration (Epic 5 Dependency):**
- Environmental conditions integrated with Epic 5 battle turn processing
- Status effects influence battle calculations and Pokemon action availability
- Weather and terrain effects modify battle outcomes and move effectiveness

**Pokemon Integration:**
- Pokemon status conditions managed through ECS components with battle state synchronization
- Environmental effects applied to Pokemon instances through Epic 3 Pokemon data integration
- Status condition tracking coordinated with Pokemon health and battle participation

**Environmental Processing Flow:**
```
Battle Turn Start → Environmental Condition Check → Status Effect Processing → Weather/Terrain Application → 
Battle Action Modification → Pokemon State Update → Environmental Duration Update → Next Turn
```

**Device Communication Pattern:**
```
HyperBeam Battle State → Environmental Condition Data → Environmental WASM Device → 
Condition Effects → Battle System Integration → Pokemon State Update
```

**Dependency Chain:**
- Requires: Epic 5 (Core Battle System & Turn Resolution) - COMPLETED ✅
- Enhances: Epic 3 (Pokemon Data System) with environmental Pokemon state management
- Enables: Epic 7 (Arena Effects), Epic 10+ (Advanced Environmental Systems)

## Technical Validation Criteria

**Environmental Performance Validation:**
- Status effect processing: <25ms per Pokemon per turn for all active status conditions
- Weather effect calculations: <50ms per turn for complete weather impact processing
- Terrain effect processing: <25ms per battle action for terrain influence calculations
- Environmental condition updates: <10ms for condition duration and intensity modifications

**Integration Parity Validation:**
- Status condition effects: 100% identical to TypeScript implementation across all status types
- Weather impact calculations: 100% identical weather modification effects on moves and Pokemon
- Terrain effect influences: 100% identical terrain impact on battle actions and outcomes
- Environmental interaction logic: 100% identical condition stacking and interaction rules

**Battle System Integration Validation:**
- Epic 5 battle integration: All environmental conditions properly integrated with battle turn processing
- Pokemon state synchronization: Environmental effects properly synchronized with Pokemon ECS components
- Turn processing: Environmental conditions correctly influence battle flow and action availability
- Battle outcome accuracy: Environmental effects properly calculated in final battle results

**Environmental System Coverage:**
