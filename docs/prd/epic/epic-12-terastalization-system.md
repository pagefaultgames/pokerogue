# Epic 12: Terastalization System

Implement comprehensive Terastalization mechanics including Tera type management, Stellar Tera implementation, Tera Crystal resources, and terastalization battle integration using Rust WASM devices within the HyperBeam ECS architecture.

## Epic Goal

Establish complete Terastalization systems by extending Pokemon Data (Epic 3) and Battle System (Epic 5) with Tera type mechanics, crystal resource management, and terastalization battle effects using type-safe Rust WASM devices maintaining 100% functional parity with TypeScript terastalization systems.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: TypeScript-based Terastalization, Tera types, crystal management, battle integration
- Technology stack: HyperBeam ECS process, Pokemon Data System (Epic 3), Core Battle System (Epic 5), Item System (Epic 9), Rust WASM devices
- Integration points: Pokemon Tera type assignment, battle Tera activation, crystal resource tracking, type effectiveness modification

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added/changed: Terastalization system migration from TypeScript to Rust WASM with ECS Tera management
- How it integrates: Terastalization WASM devices orchestrated by HyperBeam, integrated with Epic 3 Pokemon data, Epic 5 battles, and Epic 9 items
- Success criteria: 100% Terastalization parity + type-safe Tera processing + seamless multi-system integration
