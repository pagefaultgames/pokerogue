# Epic 11: Terastalization System

## Epic Goal
Implement terastalization mechanics including tera type changes, tera crystals, stellar tera type, and terastalization-triggered form changes, enabling modern Pokémon battle mechanics.

## Story 11.1: Tera Type System & Mechanics
As a **terastalization specialist**,
I want **to implement the core terastalization mechanics with proper type changing**,
so that **Pokémon can terastalize to change their type and gain battle advantages identically to current game**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Terastalization changes Pokémon's type to their designated Tera Type
2. Tera Type assignment validates against available tera types for each species
3. Terastalization provides 1.5x damage boost to moves matching the Tera Type (STAB)
4. Terastalization visual effects and indicators display properly during battle
5. Tera Type effectiveness calculations override normal type effectiveness
6. Terastalization duration lasts for entire battle once activated
7. Terastalization can only be used once per battle per team
8. Tera Type preservation maintains assigned type across battles and storage

## Story 11.2: Stellar Tera Type Implementation
As a **stellar tera developer**,
I want **to implement the special Stellar Tera Type with unique mechanics**,
so that **Stellar terastalization provides boosted damage to all move types once per type**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Stellar Tera Type provides 2x damage boost to moves of each type once per battle
2. Stellar damage boost tracking maintains which types have been boosted
3. Stellar Tera Type does not change the Pokémon's defensive typing
4. Stellar boost applies to moves of any type the Pokémon can learn
5. Stellar boost consumption prevents further boosts for each type after first use
6. Stellar Tera Type interactions with abilities function correctly
7. Stellar visual effects distinguish from regular tera types
8. Stellar Tera Type rarity and acquisition follow proper game balance

## Story 11.3: Tera Crystal & Resource System
As a **tera resource manager**,
I want **to implement tera crystal collection and usage mechanics**,
so that **players can charge their tera orb and terastalize at strategic moments**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Tera Orb charging system tracks charge level and readiness status
2. Tera crystal collection through battles and exploration charges the Tera Orb
3. Tera Orb usage validation ensures orb is charged before allowing terastalization
4. Tera Orb recharging mechanics reset charge status after use appropriately
5. Tera crystal drop rates and locations match current game distribution
6. Tera Orb charge display shows current charge status to player
7. Tera Orb mechanics prevent exploitation and maintain strategic timing
8. Tera crystal inventory management handles collection and usage properly

## Story 11.4: Terastalization Battle Integration
As a **tera battle system developer**,
I want **to integrate terastalization with existing battle mechanics**,
so that **terastalization interactions with abilities, moves, and effects work correctly**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Terastalization timing allows activation during battle command selection
2. Tera Type interactions with type-based abilities function properly
3. Terastalization effects combine correctly with other stat boosts and modifications
4. Tera-specific moves and interactions work identically to current implementation
5. Terastalization form changes (if applicable) trigger at correct timing
6. Tera Type weakness and resistance calculations override base typing
7. Terastalization animation and battle flow integration maintains proper pacing
8. Tera battle data logging tracks terastalization usage and effectiveness
