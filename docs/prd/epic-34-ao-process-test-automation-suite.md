# Epic 34: AO Process Test Automation Suite

## Epic Goal
Implement a comprehensive AO testing strategy combining bundle optimization with local testing capabilities. First resolve the critical bundle size crisis preventing deployments, then establish a robust testing environment using aolite for concurrent process testing and aos-local for individual handler development, providing developers with fast, reliable local testing capabilities that mirror production AO behavior.

## Story 34.0: Bundle Size Crisis Resolution
As a **deployment engineer**,
I want **to resolve critical AO process deployment failures due to oversized bundles**,
so that **all processes can deploy successfully to the AO network within size limits**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Bundle bloat analysis tool implemented and executed
2. Deduplication bundler with shared module pool created
3. 500KB size validation integrated into build pipeline
4. Emergency core/data splitting strategy for oversized bundles
5. All processes successfully deploy to AO network
6. Bundle optimization metrics and reporting established
7. Documentation for bundle size management workflow

## Story 34.1: Local AO Development Environment Setup
As a **AO process developer**,
I want **to establish a local AO development environment using aos-local**,
so that **I can run and test AO processes locally without network deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. aos-local installed and configured in development environment (Node.js >=18 with --experimental-wasm-memory64)
2. @permaweb/loco package installed for aos-local JavaScript API
3. Local AO process spawning capability established
4. Message sending and handler execution works locally
5. Process state inspection tools available
6. Development workflow documentation created

## Story 34.2: aolite Concurrent Process Testing Framework
As a **test automation engineer**,
I want **to implement concurrent process testing framework using aolite**,
so that **I can test multiple AO processes concurrently in controlled environments**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. aolite package installed via luarocks (Lua 5.3 requirement)
2. Multi-process emulation capability implemented
3. Message queue management for inter-process communication
4. Process lifecycle management (spawn, terminate, reset)
5. Test environment isolation and cleanup
6. Configuration system for test scenarios

## Story 34.3: aolite Handler Unit Testing Framework
As a **quality assurance engineer**,
I want **to create comprehensive unit testing framework for individual AO process handlers using aolite**,
so that **each handler can be tested in isolation with proper validation**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. aolite-based unit test framework for individual handlers established
2. Mock message generation utilities created
3. State assertion and validation helpers implemented
4. Error condition and edge case testing capabilities
5. Performance benchmark testing tools
6. Test report generation and logging
7. Integration with existing build processes

## Story 34.4: Integration Testing Suite
As a **system integration specialist**,
I want **to implement integration testing suite for multi-process AO workflows**,
so that **complex inter-process scenarios can be validated before deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration test scenarios for core game flows implemented
2. Multi-process communication testing established
3. State consistency validation across processes
4. Error propagation and recovery testing
5. Process synchronization and coordination tests
6. Test data management and cleanup
7. Automated test execution pipeline

## Story 34.5: Load and Performance Testing
As a **performance testing specialist**,
I want **to implement load and performance testing capabilities for AO processes**,
so that **system performance under load can be validated and optimized**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Load testing framework for message volume simulation
2. Concurrent user scenario testing capability
3. Performance metrics collection and analysis
4. Bottleneck identification and reporting
5. Resource usage monitoring and alerts
6. Scalability testing and validation
7. Performance regression testing

## Story 34.6: Continuous Integration Test Pipeline
As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want **to integrate test suite into continuous integration pipeline**,
so that **code changes are automatically validated before deployment**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. CI/CD pipeline integration with test suite
2. Automated test execution on code commits
3. Test result reporting and notifications
4. Deployment gate based on test results
5. Test coverage metrics and reporting
6. Developer feedback integration
7. Test failure investigation tools
