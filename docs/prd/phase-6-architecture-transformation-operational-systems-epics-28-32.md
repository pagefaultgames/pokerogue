# Phase 6: Architecture Transformation & Operational Systems (Epics 28-32)

This phase focuses on major architectural improvements, comprehensive testing frameworks, operational excellence, and system optimization to prepare for scale and long-term maintainability.

**Epic 28: Testing & Quality Assurance Systems**
Implement comprehensive testing framework ensuring zero functionality loss during TypeScript-to-Lua migration, with automated parity testing, integration testing, and quality validation.

**Epic 29: Deployment & DevOps Infrastructure**
Establish robust deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, and operational procedures for reliable AO process deployment and management.

**Epic 30: Performance Monitoring & Optimization**
Implement comprehensive performance monitoring, optimization systems, and scalability measures to ensure optimal gameplay experience under varying load conditions.

**Epic 31: Documentation & Developer Experience**
Create comprehensive documentation, developer tools, and knowledge management systems to support ongoing development, maintenance, and community contribution.

**Epic 32: Multi-Process Architecture Migration**
Decompose Pok√©Rogue's monolithic 2.1MB AO process into 6 specialized lightweight processes to improve deployment efficiency, enable parallel execution, and enhance system maintainability while maintaining 100% API compatibility and feature parity.

## Phase Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Core game mechanics must be fully implemented and tested (Phases 1-4)
- **Critical Path:** Epic 32 should be implemented after comprehensive testing framework (Epic 28) is operational
- **Integration Requirements:** All epics in this phase support the final integration phases (Phase 5)
