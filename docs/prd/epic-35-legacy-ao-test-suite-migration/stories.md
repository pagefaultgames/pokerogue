## Story 35.1: Test Suite Inventory and Migration Planning

**Story Goal:** Conduct comprehensive audit of existing test suite and develop detailed migration strategy with risk assessment and phasing plan.

**Description:** Systematically catalog the existing test infrastructure to understand scope, complexity, and dependencies before beginning migration work. This foundational analysis will inform the migration approach and identify potential risks or blockers:

- Inventory all test files, categories, and organizational structure
- Analyze custom test framework dependencies and patterns
- Assess test complexity and migration effort required
- Identify high-risk or complex tests requiring special handling
- Develop phased migration plan with rollback strategies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete inventory of 350+ test files with categorization and complexity assessment
- [ ] Documentation of existing custom test framework components and dependencies
- [ ] Migration complexity matrix identifying low/medium/high risk tests
- [ ] Phased migration plan with timeline and resource requirements
- [ ] Risk assessment with mitigation strategies for complex test cases
- [ ] Rollback plan for reverting to legacy system if needed
- [ ] Success criteria and validation approach for each migration phase

## Story 35.2: aolite Migration Tooling and Framework Adapters

**Story Goal:** Develop migration tooling and framework adapters to automate and standardize the conversion of existing tests to aolite patterns.

**Description:** Create specialized tooling to facilitate systematic migration of test cases from custom frameworks to aolite-based patterns. This includes automated conversion utilities where possible and standardized templates for manual migration:

- Build automated migration tools for common test patterns
- Create aolite-compatible adapter layer for existing assertion libraries
- Develop migration templates and patterns for different test categories
- Implement validation tools to verify migration completeness and correctness
- Create parallel execution capability for A/B testing old vs new tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Automated migration tool for converting basic test cases to aolite patterns
- [ ] aolite adapter layer preserving existing assertion library interfaces
- [ ] Migration templates for each test category (unit, integration, performance, etc.)
- [ ] Test validation framework to compare old vs new test behavior
- [ ] Parallel test execution capability for migration validation
- [ ] Migration progress tracking and reporting tools
- [ ] Documentation for migration tool usage and troubleshooting

## Story 35.3: Unit Test Migration to aolite Framework

**Story Goal:** Migrate existing unit tests to use aolite.spawnProcess() and aolite.send() patterns while preserving test logic and coverage.

**Description:** Systematically convert unit test files to leverage aolite's process spawning and message passing capabilities. Focus on maintaining existing test coverage while enhancing tests with aolite's improved state inspection and isolation capabilities:

- Convert unit test files to use aolite.spawnProcess() for handler testing
- Update test assertions to leverage aolite's direct state access
- Migrate mock message generation to use aolite.send() patterns
- Preserve existing test organization and naming conventions
- Validate that migrated tests maintain identical pass/fail behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All unit test files converted to aolite-based execution patterns
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at 100% of original coverage levels
- [ ] Migrated tests demonstrate identical pass/fail behavior to originals
- [ ] Enhanced state inspection capabilities integrated where beneficial
- [ ] Unit test execution performance meets or exceeds original performance
- [ ] Updated test documentation reflecting aolite integration patterns
- [ ] Validation report confirming zero regression in test functionality

## Story 35.4: Integration Test Migration and Multi-Process Enhancement

**Story Goal:** Migrate integration tests to leverage aolite's concurrent process capabilities for improved multi-process workflow validation.

**Description:** Convert existing integration tests to use aolite's concurrent process spawning and message queue management, enhancing tests with improved multi-process coordination and state consistency validation:

- Migrate integration tests to use aolite.spawnProcess() for multiple concurrent processes
- Update inter-process communication testing to use aolite message queues
- Enhance state consistency validation across spawned processes
- Implement improved process synchronization using aolite.runScheduler()
- Preserve existing end-to-end scenario coverage while adding concurrent capabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All integration tests converted to aolite multi-process execution model
- [ ] Enhanced concurrent process testing capabilities demonstrated
- [ ] State consistency validation improved across multiple processes
- [ ] Integration test scenarios maintain complete coverage of existing workflows
- [ ] Process coordination and synchronization enhanced through aolite.runScheduler()
- [ ] Integration test performance improved through concurrent execution
- [ ] Multi-process error handling and recovery testing enhanced

## Story 35.5: Performance, Security, and Specialized Test Migration

**Story Goal:** Migrate remaining specialized test categories (performance, security, fault-tolerance, parity) to aolite framework with category-specific enhancements.

**Description:** Complete the migration by converting specialized test categories that require unique handling or enhanced capabilities through aolite integration:

- Migrate performance tests with enhanced aolite logging and metrics collection
- Convert security tests with improved process isolation and state inspection
- Update fault-tolerance tests with aolite's process lifecycle management
- Enhance parity tests with concurrent process comparison capabilities
- Integrate specialized tests with aolite's advanced testing features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Performance tests migrated with enhanced metrics collection via aolite logging
- [ ] Security tests converted with improved process isolation capabilities
- [ ] Fault-tolerance tests enhanced with aolite process lifecycle management
- [ ] Parity tests updated with concurrent process comparison capabilities
- [ ] All specialized test categories maintain 100% of original coverage
- [ ] Enhanced testing capabilities demonstrated in each specialized category
- [ ] Specialized test execution integrated with overall aolite test suite

## Story 35.6: Legacy System Decommissioning and Final Validation

**Story Goal:** Decommission legacy test infrastructure after validating complete migration success and establishing new operational procedures.

**Description:** Complete the migration by validating all test functionality has been successfully transferred to the aolite framework, then safely decommissioning the legacy test infrastructure:

- Conduct comprehensive validation of migrated test suite functionality
- Perform side-by-side comparison of legacy vs aolite test results
- Update all documentation and operational procedures to reflect aolite-only testing
- Train development teams on new aolite-based testing workflows
- Safely decommission legacy test framework components and scripts

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Comprehensive validation confirming 100% test functionality migration
- [ ] Side-by-side test result comparison showing identical behavior
- [ ] Legacy test framework components safely removed from codebase
- [ ] All documentation updated to reflect aolite-based testing procedures
- [ ] Development team training completed on new testing workflows
- [ ] Migration success metrics validated and documented
- [ ] Post-migration monitoring plan established for ongoing validation
