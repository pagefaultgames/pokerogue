# Risk Mitigation

- **Migration Risk**: Parallel execution capability allows immediate rollback to legacy tests if issues arise
- **Coverage Loss**: Automated validation tools prevent regression in test coverage
- **Performance Impact**: Phased migration approach minimizes disruption to development workflow
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Comprehensive documentation and team training prevent operational knowledge gaps
- **Complex Test Handling**: Specialized migration tooling and manual override capability for edge cases
