# Epic Description

## Problem Statement

The existing AO process test suite represents significant organizational investment with comprehensive coverage across multiple categories (unit, integration, performance, security, fault-tolerance). This valuable test asset currently uses custom Lua test runners and frameworks that are incompatible with the new aolite-based testing infrastructure established in Epic 34. Without migration:

- **Test Investment Loss**: 350+ carefully crafted test cases become stranded assets
- **Dual Maintenance Burden**: Teams must maintain both legacy and new testing systems
- **Developer Confusion**: Inconsistent testing approaches across the codebase
- **Coverage Gaps**: Risk of losing existing test coverage during transition
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Inability to leverage new testing capabilities for existing test cases

## Solution Overview

Implement a comprehensive, phased migration strategy that systematically transitions the existing test suite to the aolite framework while preserving all test logic, organizational structure, and coverage. The migration will leverage the mature aolite infrastructure from Epic 34 to enhance existing tests with concurrent process capabilities, improved state inspection, and integrated CI/CD workflows.

## Technical Context

**Existing System Context:**
- Current functionality: 350+ Lua-based test files with custom test runners
- Test categories: unit, integration, performance, security, fault-tolerance, parity
- Framework structure: Custom assertion libraries, mock systems, and test schedulers
- Execution model: Sequential test execution with custom reporting

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being migrated: Complete existing test suite to aolite-based framework
- How it integrates: Leverages aolite concurrent process spawning, message queue management, and state inspection
- Success criteria: Zero regression in test coverage + Enhanced testing capabilities through aolite framework
