# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1:** The AO process shall implement complete battle turn resolution including damage calculation, type effectiveness, status effects, and move mechanics with 100% parity to current TypeScript implementation.

**FR2:** The system shall provide persistent player state management including character stats, experience, levels, creature roster, item inventory, and currency through AO process storage.

**FR3:** The AO handlers shall support complete creature capture mechanics including wild encounters, capture probability calculations, PC storage, and creature stat/moveset management.

**FR4:** The system shall implement world progression logic including biome advancement, gym leader battles, Elite Four encounters, and champion battles with proper difficulty scaling.

**FR5:** The system shall support complete item management including shop interactions, item effects, consumable usage, and inventory organization.

**FR6:** The AO handlers shall implement RNG systems for encounters, battle outcomes, and loot generation with deterministic reproducibility across process instances.

**FR7:** The system shall provide AO message-based APIs for all game operations enabling external system integration and agent participation.

**FR8:** The AO process shall comply with AO documentation protocol including mandatory Info handler and discoverable handler specifications.

**FR9:** The system shall support AOConnect integration enabling UI-to-AO message translation for Phase 2 browser interface.

## Non-Functional  

**NFR1:** The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime through AO's decentralized infrastructure with no single points of failure.

**NFR2:** Game state queries must return complete, accurate information within 200ms to support responsive UI integration.

**NFR3:** The AO process shall support 1,000+ concurrent active games without performance degradation or memory limitations.

**NFR4:** All game mechanics must achieve 100% functional parity with current browser version, with zero gameplay regressions during migration.

**NFR5:** The system shall provide zero data loss or corruption during gameplay sessions through AO's atomic message processing.

**NFR6:** The architecture shall be designed for future multi-process expansion while maintaining single-process MVP simplicity.
