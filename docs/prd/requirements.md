# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1:** The system shall implement a pure Entity-Component-System architecture with entities as lightweight identifiers, components as data containers, and systems as behavior processors

**FR2:** The game shall support Pokemon entities with modular components including Species, Stats, Status, Position, and BattleState data

**FR3:** The battle system shall process damage calculations, move effects, and status conditions using ECS component queries and system execution

**FR4:** The system shall provide real-time entity inspection and component debugging tools for development workflows

**FR5:** All game logic shall execute through ECS systems with clear separation between data storage and behavioral processing

**FR6:** The architecture shall support dynamic component addition/removal during runtime for flexible entity modification

**FR7:** The system shall maintain 100% functional parity with original PokÃ©Rogue gameplay mechanics through ECS implementation

**FR8:** Entity queries shall support complex filtering including required components, excluded components, and optional components

**FR9:** The system shall integrate with Arweave AO protocol for decentralized persistence and autonomous agent interaction

**FR10:** Component serialization shall enable efficient entity state persistence and cross-process communication

## Non Functional

**NFR1:** Entity queries shall achieve >90% L1 cache hit rates through archetype-based storage optimization

**NFR2:** Battle calculations shall complete in <5ms using SIMD-optimized damage computation systems

**NFR3:** System execution shall scale linearly with CPU core count through parallel processing architecture

**NFR4:** Component processing shall achieve 4-8x performance improvement over scalar operations through vectorization

**NFR5:** Memory allocation shall minimize fragmentation through custom pool allocators optimized for ECS patterns

**NFR6:** Entity processing throughput shall exceed 1 million entities per second under optimal conditions

**NFR7:** Bundle sizes for AO deployment shall remain under 500KB through optimized ECS runtime compilation

**NFR8:** Component data layouts shall maintain cache-line alignment for optimal memory access patterns

**NFR9:** Query compilation and caching shall reduce repeated query overhead to <1% of system execution time

**NFR10:** Development tools shall provide zero runtime performance impact in production builds
