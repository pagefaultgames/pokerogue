# Epic 29: Deployment & DevOps Infrastructure

## Epic Goal
Implement automated deployment pipelines, environment management, monitoring systems, and operational procedures for reliable AO process deployment and maintenance.

## Story 29.1: Automated Deployment Pipeline
As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want **to implement automated deployment pipelines for AO processes and UI components**,
so that **releases are deployed reliably with minimal manual intervention and risk**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated build pipeline compiles and packages Lua handlers with proper validation
2. Deployment automation deploys AO processes to production with zero-downtime updates
3. Rollback automation enables quick reversion to previous versions when issues occur
4. Environment promotion pipeline moves releases through development, staging, and production
5. Deployment validation confirms successful deployment before marking releases complete
6. Configuration management maintains proper settings across different environments
7. Dependency management ensures all required components are deployed together
8. Deployment monitoring tracks deployment success rates and identifies common failure points

## Story 29.2: Environment Management & Orchestration
As a **infrastructure architect**,
I want **to manage multiple deployment environments with proper isolation and resource allocation**,
so that **development, testing, and production environments remain stable and predictable**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Environment provisioning creates isolated environments for different deployment stages
2. Resource allocation ensures appropriate compute and storage resources for each environment
3. Environment synchronization maintains consistency between development and production
4. Infrastructure as code manages environment configuration through version control
5. Environment monitoring tracks resource usage and performance across all environments
6. Backup and recovery procedures protect against environment failure or data loss
7. Security hardening ensures proper access controls and network isolation
8. Cost optimization balances resource availability with operational efficiency

## Story 29.3: Operational Monitoring & Alerting
As a **operations specialist**,
I want **to implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all system components**,
so that **operational issues are detected and resolved quickly to maintain system reliability**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. System health monitoring tracks AO process availability and response times
2. Performance monitoring identifies bottlenecks and resource constraints
3. Error rate monitoring detects increased failure rates and system issues
4. User experience monitoring tracks gameplay quality and player satisfaction
5. Security monitoring identifies potential threats and unauthorized access attempts
6. Alert management routes notifications to appropriate personnel based on severity and type
7. Dashboard visualization provides real-time operational status and historical trends
8. Incident response procedures ensure rapid response to critical system issues

## Story 29.4: Maintenance & Operations Procedures
As a **operations manager**,
I want **to establish standard procedures for system maintenance and operational tasks**,
so that **routine operations are performed consistently and system reliability is maintained**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Maintenance scheduling coordinates updates and maintenance with minimal player disruption
2. Backup procedures ensure regular, reliable backups of critical game data and system state
3. Disaster recovery procedures enable rapid recovery from major system failures
4. Security procedures maintain proper access controls and vulnerability management
5. Performance optimization procedures identify and resolve system bottlenecks
6. Capacity planning procedures ensure adequate resources for growing player base
7. Documentation maintenance keeps operational procedures current and accessible
8. Training procedures ensure operations team has necessary skills and knowledge
