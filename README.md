# Pok√©Rogue AO: The First Autonomous Agent Roguelike

Pok√©Rogue is undergoing a revolutionary migration to the **AO Protocol** (Arweave ecosystem), transforming from a browser-based Pok√©mon fangame into the world's first **autonomous agent-enabled roguelike**. This migration will enable AI agents to participate as first-class players alongside humans in a fully decentralized, persistent gaming environment.

## üöÄ Migration Vision

**From Centralized Browser Game ‚Üí To Decentralized Agent Ecosystem**

- **Phase 1**: Complete game logic migration to AO processes with permanent save system
- **Phase 2**: AOConnect UI integration for seamless player experience  
- **Phase 3**: AI agents battle alongside humans in persistent PVPVE environment

## üéØ Key Benefits

- **üîí Permanent Saves**: Never lose progress again - all data stored permanently on Arweave
- **üåê Cross-Device Play**: Access your game from any device with AO connectivity
- **ü§ñ AI Agent Integration**: First roguelike where autonomous agents can play as intended
- **‚ö° Zero Downtime**: Decentralized infrastructure eliminates server outages
- **üîß Open Development**: Reproducible framework for other AO game migrations

## üèóÔ∏è Current Status: Phase 1 Development

We're currently migrating all game mechanics from TypeScript/Phaser to AO Lua handlers. This includes:

- ‚úÖ Battle system with damage calculation and status effects  
- ‚úÖ Player progression and experience systems
- ‚úÖ Creature capture and collection mechanics
- ‚úÖ Item management and shop systems
- ‚úÖ World progression and biome systems
- üîÑ Testing framework for functional parity validation

## üéÆ Final Vision: Autonomous Agent Gaming

When fully deployed, Pok√©Rogue AO will be the first roguelike where:

- **AI Agents Replace NPCs**: Autonomous agents battle as gym leaders, rivals, and wild encounters
- **Mixed Player Ecosystem**: Human players and AI agents compete in the same persistent world  
- **Agent Spectating**: Watch AI agents battle each other in real-time tournaments
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Agents develop strategies by playing against other agents
- **Zero UI Dependency**: Agents interact purely through AO message protocols

## üîß Technical Architecture

**AO Process Migration**: All game logic runs as Lua handlers on AO processes
- Battle resolution, damage calculation, status effects
- Player state management and progression tracking  
- Item systems, shops, and inventory management
- World progression and encounter generation

**Message-Based Gameplay**: Every game action becomes an AO message
```lua
-- Example: Battle turn resolution
ao.send({
  Target = GameProcess,
  Action = "BattleTurn", 
  Data = { move: "tackle", target: "enemy" }
})
```

**Permanent Storage**: Game state persists permanently on Arweave
- Cross-device accessibility
- Zero save corruption
- Historical battle records
- Progression tracking across sessions
